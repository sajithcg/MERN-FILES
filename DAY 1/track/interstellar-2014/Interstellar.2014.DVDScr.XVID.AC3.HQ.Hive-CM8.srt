00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:12,251
I N T E R S T E L L A R

3
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,203
My dad was a farmer.

4
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,270
Like everybody else back then.

5
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,125
Of course he didn't
start that way.

6
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,607
The computer says
you're too tight.

7
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,568
No, I got this!
- Crossing the Straits.

8
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:39,226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
- Heyyy.

9
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:43,279
Shutting all down... -Hey, we do
not have to shut down anything!

10
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,339
Dad?

11
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,747
Sorry Murph. Go
back to bed babe.

12
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,458
I thought you were the ghost.

13
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:06,082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
- Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

14
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,854
No, that's because grandpa
is too close to...

15
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:12,530
being one himself.
Go back to bed.

16
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,577
Were you dreaming
about the crash?

17
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,465
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

18
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,068
The wheat had died.

19
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:51,224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

20
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:56,141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

21
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,317
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

22
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:05,801
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

23
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,245
We wore little
strips of sheet...

24
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:15,312
sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

25
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,216
Well when we set the table we
always set the plate upside down.

26
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,938
Glasses or cups, whatever
it was, upside down.

27
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:33,569
Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on.
- One o'clock today, you and me...

28
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,146
in the barn, Herbicide
Resistance 101, check? -Yes sir.

29
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,059
Not at the table Murph!

30
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,761
Dad, can you fix this?

31
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:47,189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
- It wasn't me.

32
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
- It knocked it off my shelf.

33
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,819
It also knocks the books off. -There's
no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

34
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,030
Hey. -I looked it up, it's
called a poltergeist.

35
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,740
Dad, tell her. -Well, that's
not very scientific Murph.

36
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:03,637
You said that science was about admitting
what we don't know. -She's got you there.

37
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,841
Hey, start looking
after all our stuff.

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,580
Coop.

39
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:13,373
Alright Murph, you
wanna talk science?

40
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:17,846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of
some ghost. No, you gotta go further.

41
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,079
You have to record the
facts, analyze...

42
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:24,391
get to the how and the why and
present your conclusions. Deal?

43
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,765
Deal. -All right!

44
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,292
Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

45
00:04:31,364 --> 00:04:35,636
Parent-Teacher conferences,
parent, not grandparent.

46
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,625
Slow down turbo. That's
not a dust storm.

47
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:45,708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
- Blight?

48
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:50,364
They're saying it's the last
harvest for okra. Ever.

49
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,770
He should have planted
corn like the rest of

50
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:57,147
us. -Now you be nice
to that Miss Hanley.

51
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,603
She's single. -Well what's
that supposed to mean?

52
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,977
Repopulating the Earth. -Start
pulling your weight young man.

53
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,176
Why don't you start minding
your own business? Old man!

54
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,767
All right Murph give me second.

55
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:20,771
Aha,....thirrrd.

56
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,707
Find a gear dumbass. -Grind it!
- Shut it Tom!

57
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,504
Whatcha do Murph? -Ahh,
she didn't do nothing.

58
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:33,172
Blew a tire is all. -Murphy's Law.
- Shut up!

59
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:36,076
Grab the spare Tom.
- That is the spare.

60
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:39,278
Get the patch kit.

61
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,895
And how am I supposed
to patch it out here?

62
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not
always gonna be here to help you.

63
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:56,767
What's goin' on Murph?

64
00:05:56,842 --> 00:06:01,567
Why did you and mom name me after
something that's bad? -No we didn't?

65
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,473
Murphy's Law?

66
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad...

67
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,637
will happen. What it means
is whatever can happen...

68
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,346
will happen. And that
sounded just fine with us.

69
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,131
Get in.

70
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:24,838
Get in, let's go.

71
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,701
What about the flat tire?

72
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:32,347
Yes.

73
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:51,208
It is an Indian Air Force drone. Solar
cells could power an entire farm.

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Take the wheel Tom.

75
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:00,366
Go, go go!

76
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:02,075
Keep it pointed at that.

77
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,007
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
- Yes.

78
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:14,956
Point right at it.

79
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,361
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

80
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,405
Nice driving Tom.

81
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,280
Dad? -Almost got it,
don't stop, don't stop.

82
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,332
Dad?! Tom!!!

83
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:51,092
Wha..? You told me
to keep driving.

84
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,566
Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I
ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.

85
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:02,662
We lost it. -No we didn't!

86
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:17,010
Wanna give it a whirl?

87
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:35,400
Let's land it down there, right
at the edge of the reservoir.

88
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:41,082
Nicely done!

89
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,975
How long do you think
it's been up there?

90
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:49,925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

91
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,701
So for 10 years?

92
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:58,354
Why'd it come down so low?
- I don't know.

93
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:02,604
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain or
it was looking for something. -What?

94
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:06,150
Give me that large flat blade
Maybe some kind of signal.

95
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,441
I don't know.

96
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,073
What are you gonna do with it?

97
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:18,009
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

98
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:22,574
like driving a combine.
- Can't we just, let it go?

99
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

100
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,172
Listen, this thing needs to learn how
to adapt Murph, like the rest of us.

101
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
- I've got class.

102
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,554
This one, needs to wait.

103
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:46,782
What did you do? -They'll tell you
about it when you get in there.

104
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:49,353
Well am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

105
00:09:49,462 --> 00:09:50,756
Just please, try not to.

106
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:54,766
Hey, relax....I got this.

107
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:02,647
You're late Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

108
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:06,684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

109
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:10,034
No actually sir, that's a,
that's a surveillance drone.

110
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,947
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian. -Take a seat.

111
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:20,241
So, we got Tom's scores back.

112
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:25,074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
- Yeah he's got a knack for it.

113
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,448
What about college?

114
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:30,808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

115
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,800
- I still pay my taxes. Where does that
money go? There's no more armies.

116
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:37,802
Well, they don't go
to the university.

117
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,655
Look Coop, you have
to be realistic.

118
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:45,133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

119
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
- What's your waistline?

120
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,650
How about 32, about 33 inseam? -I'm not
sure I see where you're getting at.

121
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,896
You're telling me it takes two
numbers to measure your own ass...

122
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:59,348
but only one to
measure my son's future?

123
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,058
Come on, you're a
well-educated man Coop...

124
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,407
and a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

125
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:10,264
Okay well right now, we
don't need more engineers.

126
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:15,341
We didn't run out of television screens
or planes; we ran out of food!

127
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:19,813
The world needs farmers. Good
farmers like you, and Tom.

128
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:24,652
Uneducated farmers. -We are a
caretaker generation Coop.

129
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:28,473
And things are getting better. Maybe
your grandkids will get to be...

130
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:29,474
-Are we done here sir?

131
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:34,678
No. Miss Hanley is here
to talk about Murph.

132
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:37,301
Murph is a great kid,
she's really bright. But

133
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,655
she's been having a
little trouble lately.

134
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,718
She brought this in
to show the other

135
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,100
students. The section
on the lunar landings.

136
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:48,631
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

137
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:52,633
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

138
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,477
Corrected? -Explaining how the Apollo
missions were faked to bankrupt...

139
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:58,669
the Soviet Union.

140
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,187
You don't believe we
went to the Moon?

141
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,653
I believe it was a brilliant
piece of propaganda

142
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,693
that the Soviets
bankrupted themselves...

143
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:15,328
pouring resources into rockets
and other useless machines.

144
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:16,876
Useless machines?

145
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:20,864
And if we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century...

146
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,721
then we need to teach our kids about
this planet. Not tales of leaving it.

147
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,421
You know one of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

148
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:33,033
And if we had any of those left, the
doctors would've been able to find...

149
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:37,064
the cyst in my wife's brain before
she died; instead of afterwards.

150
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:39,083
And then she would have
been the one sitting

151
00:12:39,095 --> 00:12:40,837
here listening to
this instead of me...

152
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:45,604
which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

153
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:48,851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr.
Cooper.

154
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,404
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates...

155
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,809
over this Apollo nonsense.

156
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,955
So we thought it would be best to bring you
in and see what ideas you might have...

157
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,765
for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.

158
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:05,536
Yeah, you know what, there's
a game tomorrow night.

159
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:09,419
She's going through a bit of a baseball
phase, her favorite team is playing.

160
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:11,089
There's gonna be
candy and soda...

161
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:16,976
I think I'll take her to that.

162
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:25,980
How'd it go? -I got
you suspended.

163
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,247
What?? -Cooper.

164
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:33,925
This is Cooper, go. -Coop, those
combines you rebuilt went haywire.

165
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:38,651
Just reset the controllers. -I did
that, but you should come take a look.

166
00:13:58,978 --> 00:14:01,758
One by one they just teared off
the fields and headed over.

167
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,573
Something's interfering
with the compass.

168
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:08,134
Magnetism. Or somethin' such.

169
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

170
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:58,344
I counted the spaces. -Why?

171
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:04,834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

172
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:09,624
Morse? -Yeah, dots and dashes.
It's...

173
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:12,020
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

174
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:14,222
bookshelf is trying
to talk to you.

175
00:15:25,678 --> 00:15:30,104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

176
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:33,015
Which is? -I don't know.

177
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,850
Now if the house had been
built on magnetic ore...

178
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:39,730
we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

179
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:45,694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

180
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:52,182
You heard? It's like we've
forgotten who we are, Donald.

181
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:57,145
Explorers, pioneers,
not caretakers.

182
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:03,882
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

183
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:07,121
Some gadget or idea.

184
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:11,875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6, billion people,

185
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,864
Just try to imagine that.

186
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:18,219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

187
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,178
This world isn't so bad.

188
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:29,548
And Tom will do just fine. You're
the one who doesn't belong.

189
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

190
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:35,779
My daughter knew it.
God bless her.

191
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,664
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

192
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:43,086
Ahh we used to look up
to the sky and wonder...

193
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,483
at our place in the stars.

194
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,774
Now we just look down,

195
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:53,847
and worry about our
place in the dirt.

196
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:56,397
Cooper, you were
good at something,

197
00:16:56,475 --> 00:17:00,071
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

198
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,906
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:07,320
You didn't expect this dirt that
was giving you this food...

200
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,222
to turn on you like
that and destroy you.

201
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:16,212
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I, I think.

202
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:20,671
This just happened at about 1:30 when that
thing came off the top of the canyon.

203
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:26,025
In my day we had real ball players.
Who're these bums?

204
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,835
Well in my day, people
were too busy...

205
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,247
fighting over food
to even play baseball.

206
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:36,149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

207
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,567
School says you're gonna
follow in my footsteps.

208
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:42,679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

209
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:46,570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

210
00:17:46,678 --> 00:17:51,320
Grandpa said huh? Listen, all that
matters is how you feel about it.

211
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:55,573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

212
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,706
And you're gonna be great at it.

213
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,134
Let's get outta here.

214
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:24,138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

215
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,255
Tom, Murph? -Check. -Check?

216
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:25,198
Murph, Tom, you guys
shut your windows?

217
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,543
Murph.

218
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:56,117
The ghost. -Grab your pillow.

219
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,570
You're sleeping with Tom.

220
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,336
It's not a ghost.

221
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:01,990
It's gravity.

222
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,483
I'm dropping Tom, then
heading into town.

223
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:10,917
You wanna clean that up? When
you've finished praying to it.

224
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,917
It's not Morse
Murph, it's binary.

225
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,441
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

226
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:46,734
Coordinates.

227
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:04,911
That's it. -I can't miss this.

228
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:07,572
Grandpa will be back in a
couple of hours Murph.

229
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:10,627
But you don't know what
you're gonna find.

230
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:16,542
And that, is why I
can't take you.

231
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,671
Murph?

232
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,081
Grandpa will be home in a while,
tell him I'll call him on the radio.

233
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:39,195
Jesus! What're you doing?

234
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,909
Oh do you think it's funny? Huh?

235
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:44,814
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

236
00:22:46,794 --> 00:22:49,231
Make yourself useful.

237
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:53,253
Hey Murph.

238
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,952
Murph.

239
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:01,857
I think this is the
end of the road.

240
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:06,357
Didn't you bring
the bolt cutters?

241
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:09,604
That's my girl.

242
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,617
Step away from the fence. -Don't
shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

243
00:24:40,724 --> 00:24:41,981
My daughter is in the car.

244
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:49,223
Don't be afraid.

245
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:06,150
How did you find this place?
- Where is my daughter?

246
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:08,358
You had the coordinates
for this facility marked

247
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,518
on your map. Where did you
get those coordinates?

248
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:14,378
Where is my daughter?! -Don't make
me take you down again, sit down!

249
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:17,434
Oh do you still think
you're a Marine pal?

250
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:19,848
Marines don't exist.
And you know what?

251
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:23,662
I've got grunts like
you mowing my grass.

252
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,849
Where did you find those coordinates?
- Unless

253
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:27,848
you wanna end up as my
second lawnmower...

254
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:32,721
no, I think I'll turn you into a valve
of a vacuum or a dry cleaner. No you won't.

255
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,686
TARS, back down please.

256
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:41,018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

257
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:45,202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

258
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:47,219
It's what the
government could spare.

259
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,815
Who are you? -Dr. Brand.

260
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:56,785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a
Professor. -What makes you think I'm not?

261
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,494
Wasn't near as cute either.

262
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:02,350
Please Dr. Brand, I don't
have any idea what this is.

263
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:05,629
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

264
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:08,228
You give me that, and I'll tell
you anything you want to know.

265
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,797
Take the principal and the
girl to the conference room.

266
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

267
00:26:18,927 --> 00:26:23,461
Must have a very smart mother. -It's
pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

268
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:27,878
Why don't you let us back up from your
fence and we'll be on our way, huh?

269
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,801
It's not that simple.
- Well, sure it is.

270
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:33,953
Look I don't know anything about you. I
don't know anything about this place.

271
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:36,239
Yes you do.

272
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:43,003
Dad!

273
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,230
Hello Cooper.

274
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:49,718
Professor Brand.

275
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,684
Explain to me how you
found this facility.

276
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:57,220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

277
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,851
You're sitting in the best
kept secret in the world.

278
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:02,757
Nobody stumbles in here,
nobody stumbles out.

279
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,698
Cooper, please, cooperate
with these people.

280
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:12,013
Well, it's kinda
hard to explain.

281
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:16,122
We we.., we learnt
these coordinates...

282
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:18,763
from an anomaly.
- What sort of anomaly?

283
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:22,699
I hesitate to term it supernatural but
it damn well wasn't scientific...

284
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:27,650
You're gonna have to be specific Mr.
Cooper, right now. -It was gravity.

285
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:35,412
Um what sort of gravitational
an-where was this thing?

286
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,908
Hey, I'm real happy that you're
excited about gravity bud, but...

287
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:43,478
you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances. -Assurances? -Yeah.

288
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,510
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

289
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:54,349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
- No Professor, I don't.

290
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:58,059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

291
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,079
NASA. -NASA.

292
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,744
The same NASA, you flew for.

293
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:18,530
I heard they shut you down sir, for
refusing to drop bombs from...

294
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:21,048
the stratosphere on
the starving people.

295
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,764
When they realized that
killing other people...

296
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:28,299
was not a long term solution,
then they needed us back. In secret.

297
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:30,879
Why secret? -Because
public opinion wouldn't

298
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,930
allow spending on
space exploration.

299
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:35,765
Not when you're struggling
to put food on the table.

300
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:41,159
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

301
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:44,434
Okra, this year. -Now,
there's just corn.

302
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:47,145
And we're growing more
than we ever had.

303
00:28:47,256 --> 00:28:51,605
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

304
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:56,397
the corn will die. Soon.

305
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:05,262
We'll find a way,
Professor, we always have.

306
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:10,164
Driven by the unshakeable
faith that the Earth is ours?

307
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,296
Well not just ours, no.

308
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:14,824
But it is our home.

309
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:19,475
Earth's atmosphere
is 80% nitrogen.

310
00:29:19,584 --> 00:29:21,515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

311
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,241
Blight does, and as it thrives, our
air gets less and less oxygen.

312
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:30,178
The last people to starve, will
be the first to suffocate.

313
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,577
And your daughter's
generation...

314
00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:36,347
will be the last
to survive on Earth.

315
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:38,272
Murph is feeling a
little tired, and was

316
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,421
wondering if she could
take a nap in my office?

317
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,952
Yeah, thank you.

318
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,003
Okay.

319
00:29:46,147 --> 00:29:50,211
Now you need to tell me, what
your plan is to save the world?

320
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

321
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:05,194
Rangers. -The last components of
our one versatile ship in orbit.

322
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:09,105
The Endurance. Our
final expedition.

323
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:13,183
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

324
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,185
The Lazarus missions.
- Sounds cheerful!

325
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:20,552
Lazarus came back from the dead. -Sure,
but he had to die in the first place.

326
00:30:20,662 --> 00:30:23,087
There's not a planet in our solar
system that could sustain...

327
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,569
life and the nearest star
is over a 1000 years away.

328
00:30:26,604 --> 00:30:28,703
I mean, it doesn't even
qualify as futile.

329
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,135
Where did you send them?

330
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:38,004
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

331
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

332
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:44,925
This team never
left the simulator!

333
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:48,460
We need a pilot, and this is the
mission that you were trained for.

334
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,544
What, without even knowing?

335
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,649
An hour ago, you didn't even know I
was alive, and you were going anyway.

336
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:59,785
We had no choice. But
something sent you here.

337
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,393
They chose you. -Who's 'They'?

338
00:31:10,142 --> 00:31:14,213
How long, would I be gone?
- Hard to know.

339
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:18,232
Years. -I've got kids Professor.

340
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,505
Get out there, and save them.

341
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:28,190
Who's 'They'? -We started detecting
gravitational anomalies,

342
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:30,044
almost 50 years ago.

343
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

344
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,004
In fact I believe you
encountered one yourself.

345
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:39,411
Yeah, in the Straits.

346
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:43,694
My crash, something
tripped my fly-by-wire.

347
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:50,628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

348
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:54,692
Out near Saturn. A
disturbance of space-time.

349
00:31:56,252 --> 00:32:00,389
Is that a wormhole? -It
appeared 48 years ago.

350
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:04,597
And it leads, where?
- Another galaxy.

351
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,060
A wormhole is not a naturally
occurring phenomenon.

352
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,702
Someone placed it there.
- 'They'?

353
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:16,934
And whoever they are, they
appear to be looking out for us.

354
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:20,179
That wormhole let us
travel to other stars.

355
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,452
It came right around
when we needed it.

356
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:25,688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

357
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:29,701
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
- You sent probes into that?

358
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,381
We sent people into
it, 10 years ago.

359
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,044
The Lazarus missions.

360
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,784
12 possible worlds,
12 Ranger launches.

361
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:43,129
Carrying the bravest
humans ever to live.

362
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:46,084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

363
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,361
Each person's landing pod had
enough life support for two years.

364
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:51,015
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

365
00:32:51,124 --> 00:32:55,120
making observations on
organics over a decade or more.

366
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,529
Their mission was to
assess their world and...

367
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,485
if it showed potential,
then they could send

368
00:32:59,497 --> 00:33:01,310
out a signal and bed
down for the long nap...

369
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,743
wait to be rescued. -And what
if the world didn't show promise?

370
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,789
Hence the bravery.

371
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:12,120
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12. -No.

372
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:16,039
Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary.

373
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:19,030
Simple binary pings
on an annual basis...

374
00:33:19,126 --> 00:33:23,823
give us some clue as to which worlds
have potential. One system shows promise.

375
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:26,192
Well one, that's a bit
of a long shot isn't it?

376
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,796
One system with 3
potential worlds?

377
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,695
Not a long shot.

378
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:37,924
Wait. So if we find a home...

379
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:44,889
then what? -That's
the long shot.

380
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:48,246
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

381
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:52,278
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

382
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,465
This entire facility
is a centrifuge.

383
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:11,591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
- Both. The plan A.

384
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:13,214
How do you get it
off the ground?

385
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:17,637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

386
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:22,173
Suddenly we knew that
harnessing gravity was real.

387
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:26,196
So I started working on a
theory and we started...

388
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:29,510
building this station. -But
you haven't solved it yet.

389
00:34:29,656 --> 00:34:32,350
That's why there's a plan B.

390
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:34,700
The problem is gravity.

391
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,689
How to get a viable amount of
human life off the planet?

392
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:41,871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

393
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:46,217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs weighing
in at just under 900 kilos.

394
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:50,014
How would you raise 'em?
- With the equipment

395
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:51,834
onboard we incubate
the first ten.

396
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:55,615
After that, with surrogacy the
growth becomes exponential.

397
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,789
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

398
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:03,983
The real difficulty with
colonization is genetic diversity.

399
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,154
This will take care of that.

400
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:10,047
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on 'em?

401
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:15,165
My kids? -That's why Plan
A is a lot more fun.

402
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:20,747
How far have you got?
- Almost there.

403
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,768
You're asking me to
hang everything...

404
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,387
on an 'almost'. -I'm
asking you to trust me.

405
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:33,497
Find us a new home.

406
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:38,096
And by the time you return, I
would've solved the problem...

407
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:41,650
of gravity. I
give you my word.

408
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,621
Go away!

409
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:10,697
Murph. -Go. If you're
leaving just go!

410
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:17,352
This world was never enough
for you, was it Cooper?

411
00:36:17,437 --> 00:36:21,892
What, cause heading out there is what
I feel like... I was born to do?

412
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,883
And it excites me?

413
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:28,352
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
- It might.

414
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:32,295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

415
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:37,324
The 'why' of the thing, that's the
foundation. -And the foundation's solid.

416
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:43,208
We farmers, we sit here
every year when...

417
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:47,171
the rains fail, and
we say: Next year.

418
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:51,380
Well, next year ain't gonna save
us, nor the one after that.

419
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,198
This world's a treasure Donald, but it's
been telling us to leave for a while now.

420
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:04,721
Mankind was born on Earth, it
was never meant to die here.

421
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:12,387
Tom will be alright, but you got to
make things right with Murph. -I will.

422
00:37:12,702 --> 00:37:16,442
Without making promises you
don't know you can keep.

423
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,889
You have to talk to me Murph.

424
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:34,779
I need to fix this before I go.

425
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,408
Then I'll keep it broken
so you'll have to stay.

426
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,698
After you kids came
along, your mom, she said

427
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,513
something to me I never
quite understood.

428
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:49,407
She said: Now,
we're just here...

429
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,572
to be the memories for our kids.

430
00:37:57,214 --> 00:38:00,170
I think I now understand
what she meant.

431
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,794
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

432
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

433
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:19,469
That's right Murph.

434
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,469
Look at me.

435
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:29,486
I can't be your ghost right now.

436
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:33,223
I need to exist.

437
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:37,249
They chose me.

438
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,282
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

439
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,779
And that's exactly
why you can't go!

440
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:54,819
I figured out the message. One word.
You know what it is?

441
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:57,530
Murph. -STAY.

442
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,954
It says STAY dad. -Murph.

443
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,868
You don't believe me! Look at the books.
Look it says STAY.

444
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:10,380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
- I'm coming back.

445
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,610
When??

446
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:28,480
One for you. One for me.

447
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:30,493
When I'm up there in hyper sleep,

448
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:34,216
or, or traveling at
the speed of light,

449
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,856
or, near a black hole,

450
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,306
Time is gonna change for me.

451
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

452
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,742
So, when we get back,

453
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:50,575
we're gonna compare. -Time
will run differently for us?

454
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,518
Yeah.

455
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:55,769
Maybe by the time I get back, you
and I, we might be the same age.

456
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:58,436
You and me. What??

457
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,024
Imagine that!

458
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:07,731
Ah, Murph. -You've no idea
when you're coming back!!

459
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:13,003
No idea at all! -Murph.

460
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:18,324
Murph, don't ma-, don't make
me leave like this. Murph!

461
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:21,100
Don't make me leave
like this Murph!!

462
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,882
Hey,...I love you.

463
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:35,895
You hear me? I love you forever.

464
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,407
And I'm coming back.

465
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:44,905
I'm coming back.

466
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,370
How did it go? -Fine.

467
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:06,921
Just fine.

468
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay? -Yeah.
Take care of our place for me alright?

469
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:23,146
Huh? -Uh huh.

470
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:29,527
Hey, can I use your truck while
you're gone? -You mean your truck?

471
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,090
I'll make sure they
bring it back.

472
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,661
Look after my kids Donald.

473
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:53,282
Go for main engines.
Start T minus 10.

474
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,993
Dad! -9 -Dad!!

475
00:41:58,028 --> 00:42:02,467
8, 7. -DAD!!!

476
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:07,815
6, 5. Main engines start.

477
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:15,928
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster
ignition, and.

478
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:27,511
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

479
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:35,064
Prepare for stage
one separation.

480
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:37,006
Stage one.

481
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:48,199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

482
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,768
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

483
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:58,460
He thinks it relaxes us.
- A giant sarcastic robot!

484
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:03,791
What a great idea! -I have a cue light I
could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?

485
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:05,066
That wouldn't be a problem, no.

486
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:07,281
Yeah you could use it to
find your way back into

487
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,230
the ship after I blow
you out the air lock.

488
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,270
What's your humor setting TARS?

489
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,276
100% -Let's bring it
down to 75 please.

490
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:18,229
Stage two separation.

491
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,519
All feeds going manual.
- Going manual.

492
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:37,644
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
- Check.

493
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:46,100
Taking control. -This
is handover to you.

494
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:51,683
ABF check. Over.

495
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:56,378
Retro thrusters
fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

496
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:00,049
100% ex-mites.

497
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

498
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,921
Your father. -We're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

499
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:19,601
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

500
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:25,478
Just being honest. -Well you
don't need to be that honest.

501
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:30,010
Hey TARS, what's your
honesty parameter? -90%

502
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:31,633
90%?

503
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:35,273
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic...

504
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:39,022
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings. -Okay!

505
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:41,478
90% it is Dr. Brand.

506
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:48,532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

507
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:07,605
Okay taking control.

508
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:13,836
Approaching module
port, 500 meters.

509
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:28,655
It's all you Doyle.

510
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:49,691
Nice and easy Doyle,
nice and easy.

511
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:57,481
Take us home.

512
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,815
Target locked.

513
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:09,379
Target locked. -Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

514
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:10,535
Good job.

515
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

516
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:13,342
Cooper, you should have control.
- Control here.

517
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:17,062
Communication with
ring module active.

518
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,652
That's initiate.

519
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:42,410
Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

520
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:56,410
Hello CASE. -Hello TARS.

521
00:47:57,132 --> 00:48:00,804
Okay, we're all set.
- All right let's do it.

522
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:32,048
30% of spin.

523
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,466
One g.

524
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,227
How is gravity treating
you back there?

525
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:51,143
Romilly, hey you okay? -Yeah.
- You all right?

526
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:52,454
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

527
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,307
Okay, I think we have some Dramamine in
the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that.

528
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:59,690
It'll be in the cryo beds Just be a sec.
- Hey Brand?

529
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

530
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:13,439
Amelia, be safe.

531
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:17,720
Give my regards to Dr.
Mann. -I will Dad.

532
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:22,791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

533
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

534
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:27,880
Look after my family
will you please, sir?

535
00:49:28,023 --> 00:49:31,260
We'll be waiting for
you, when you get back.

536
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:36,333
A little older, a little
wiser, but happy to see you.

537
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:41,771
'Do not go gentle into
that good night, '

538
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:46,664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day, '

539
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:52,567
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

540
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:57,809
'Though wise men at their
end, know dark is right.'

541
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:00,829
'Because their words had
forked no lightning they'

542
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:04,384
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

543
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:09,710
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

544
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:35,085
Here, pills.

545
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:42,028
So alone. -We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

546
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:43,436
I mean them.

547
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,050
It's a perfect planet and we're not
gonna find another one like it.

548
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:53,579
No, it's not like,
looking for a new condo.

549
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:57,803
The human race is
going to be, adrift.

550
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:01,876
Desperate for a rock it can cling
to while it catches it's breath.

551
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,569
We need to find that rock,

552
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:08,698
and our 3 prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

553
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:13,902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

554
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:22,395
Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

555
00:51:23,436 --> 00:51:25,844
Oh, um, Wolf's a
particle physicist.

556
00:51:28,441 --> 00:51:30,206
Any of them had any families?

557
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:34,515
No, no attachments.
My father insisted.

558
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:37,327
They 'all knew the
possibility of...

559
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:40,330
seeing another human being again. I'm
hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.

560
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,741
Dr. Mann? -Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.
He's the best of us.

561
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:47,804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

562
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,836
in human history.

563
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:52,238
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

564
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:55,404
You know out there, we
would face great odds.

565
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,745
Death. But, not evil.

566
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,228
You don't think
nature can be evil?

567
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:07,193
No. Formidable, frightening.
But, no, not evil.

568
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:12,495
Is a lion evil because it
rips a gazelle to shreds?

569
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,481
Just what we take with us then?

570
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:19,349
Yeah. This crew represents
the best of humanity.

571
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:22,532
Even me, huh? -You know what?
We agreed, 90%.

572
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:24,842
Don't stay up.

573
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:26,114
I'll be in a minute.

574
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:30,418
Just remember Coop, you're
literally wasting your breath.

575
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,962
Hey TARS, let's go over that
trajectory one more time.

576
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,886
8 months to Mars. Gravity
powered slingshot around,

577
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,345
14 months to Saturn. Nothing
has changed on that.

578
00:52:47,493 --> 00:52:48,970
Let me ask you something.

579
00:52:51,454 --> 00:52:54,692
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. -Why are you
whispering? They can't hear you.

580
00:52:56,568 --> 00:53:01,540
Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close?
- I wouldn't know.

581
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:04,613
Is that '90% wouldn't know'
or '10% wouldn't know'?

582
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,812
I also have a discretion
setting Cooper.

583
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,177
But not a poker-face slick.

584
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:24,961
Hey guys.

585
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:28,782
Dad's about to go down
for the long nap.

586
00:53:28,928 --> 00:53:31,732
And I just, wanted to
give you an update.

587
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:35,745
The Earth looks
amazing from here.

588
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:40,035
You can't see any of the dust.

589
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:44,432
I really hope you guys
are doin', doin' great.

590
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,325
I know you're gonna
get this message,

591
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,736
Professor Brand assured
me that he was gonna

592
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:51,855
get it to you. Alright,
okay I love you!

593
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,468
Is it him? -I don't
think so Murph.

594
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:04,432
You must be Donald.

595
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:10,314
Hello Murph. -Why are
you in my dad's truck?

596
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:13,127
He wanted me to bring
it for your brother.

597
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,903
He sent you a message.

598
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,275
She's pretty upset
with him for leaving.

599
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:24,802
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

600
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:33,303
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe, I should fan the flame.

601
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:35,647
She's already making fools
of her teachers, well,

602
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:37,980
maybe she should come and
make a fool out of you.

603
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,513
So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

604
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:47,014
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

605
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:30,376
They want me to repeat
plant pathology.

606
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:35,958
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

607
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:39,883
So... alright. Well,
I gotta go Dad.

608
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,145
Hope you're safe up there.

609
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:49,005
Sorry Coop, I asked
Murph to say hi.

610
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:54,016
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

611
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,682
Are you okay Rom?

612
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:16,603
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

613
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:20,200
Millimeters of aluminum
protecting us and then nothing...

614
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:24,054
out there for millions of
miles, won't kill us in seconds.

615
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:30,048
Did you know that some of the finest
solo yachtsmen in the world...

616
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:34,741
don't know how to swim? They don't know,
and if they go overboard, it's done.

617
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:38,578
We are explorers Rom.

618
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:43,132
This is our boat. Here.

619
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:14,937
This is the, relay probe? -In
orbit around the wormhole.

620
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:17,566
This is the wormhole and
every time we come around...

621
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:21,416
we would receive images from the
other side of the foreign galaxy.

622
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:25,015
Like swinging a periscope around.
- Exactly.

623
00:57:25,129 --> 00:57:29,030
So we got a pretty good idea, what we're
gonna find on the other side, huh?

624
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:31,982
Navigationally.

625
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:35,175
Hey guys, looks like we're
gonna be approaching

626
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:36,705
the wormhole in
about three hours.

627
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,721
Hey Coop, can we
stop the spinning?

628
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:50,790
Why? -Because we are
close enough to see it.

629
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:54,971
Aha.

630
00:57:59,191 --> 00:58:03,403
Look, that's, that's it!
That's the wormhole!

631
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,473
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

632
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:10,176
Well of course it is! What you
thought it would just be a hole?

633
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:15,107
No. It's just that all the
illustrations I've ever seen they...

634
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:19,117
The illustrations, try
to show how it works.

635
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:23,439
So they say you want to
go from here, to there.

636
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,078
But this is too far.

637
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:28,884
So a wormhole bends space
like this so you...

638
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:32,507
can take a shortcut
through a higher dimension.

639
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:37,412
Okay so, to show that they've
turned 3-dimensional space...

640
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:41,785
into 2 dimensions, which turns
a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

641
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:44,952
a circle. What's a
circle in 3 dimensions?

642
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,314
A sphere. -Exactly.
A spherical hole.

643
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,439
But who put it there? Who
do we have to thank?

644
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,374
I'm not thanking anybody until we
get outta here in one piece Rom.

645
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:06,791
Any trick to this Doyle?

646
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:09,530
No one knows.

647
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:18,814
The others made it, right?

648
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:22,638
At least some of 'em.

649
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,491
Everybody ready to say
goodbye to our solar system?

650
00:59:57,638 --> 01:00:00,223
To our galaxy.

651
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:03,478
Here we go.

652
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:39,152
Controls won't work here. We
are passing through the bulk.

653
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:44,090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions. All
you can do is report and observe.

654
01:00:54,008 --> 01:00:56,532
What is that?

655
01:00:57,806 --> 01:01:02,597
I think it's 'Them'.
- Distorting space-time?

656
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,279
Don't. Don't!

657
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,900
What was that?

658
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,378
First handshake.

659
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:42,322
We're...

660
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:44,737
We're here.

661
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,910
So the lost communications
came through. -How?

662
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:13,985
The relay on this side cached them. It's
years of basic data, no real surprises.

663
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:19,480
Miller's site has kept pinging
'thumbs up', as has Dr. Mann's.

664
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:23,319
Edmunds went down three years ago.
- Transmitter failure?

665
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:26,313
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs
up right until it went dark.

666
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:30,079
But Miller's still looks good though,
right? Because she's coming up fast.

667
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:32,428
But there's one complication.

668
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:36,577
The planet is much closer to
Gargantua than we thought.

669
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:39,775
Gargantua? -It's what we're
calling the black hole.

670
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:41,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's
planets both orbit it.

671
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:45,194
And Miller's is on the horizon?
- Like a basketball around a hoop.

672
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:47,915
Landing there takes us
dangerously close...

673
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:51,185
and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

674
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:56,820
Okay I-, I could swing
around that neutron star...

675
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:59,485
- No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

676
01:02:59,632 --> 01:03:02,920
slow our clock compared to Earth's,..
Drastically.

677
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:04,683
Well how bad?

678
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:11,596
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth.

679
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,804
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

680
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:20,204
Well, we can't just drop down
there without... -Cooper...

681
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:22,790
We have a mission. -Yeah
Doyle, we have a mission.

682
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:25,437
And our mission, Plan A
is to find a planet...

683
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,978
that can habitat the people that
are living on the Earth right now.

684
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:29,374
You can't just think
about your family, now

685
01:03:29,386 --> 01:03:30,714
you have to think bigger
than that, alright?

686
01:03:30,864 --> 01:03:33,809
I'm thinking about my family and
millions of other families.

687
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:36,397
Okay, Plan A does not
work, if the people on

688
01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:38,816
Earth are dead by the
time we pull it off.

689
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:43,058
No, it doesn't. That's
why there's a Plan B.

690
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:49,225
Okay. Cooper's right. We have to think
about time as a resource just like...

691
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,676
oxygen and food. Going
down there is gonna cost us.

692
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:58,048
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data
is promising, alright,

693
01:03:58,192 --> 01:04:01,670
but it's gonna take us months to get
there, and Edmunds, it's even further.

694
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:04,237
Now Miller hasn't said much. But
what she has said is very promising.

695
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:07,141
It's water, it's organics.
- You don't find that everyday.

696
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,662
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

697
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,038
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

698
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:16,148
Romilly. -Yeah.

699
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:20,594
How far off of Miller's planet do we have
to be to stay out of the time shift?

700
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:24,876
Alright, just back from the cusp. -Which
is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

701
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:27,428
Alright. Okay.

702
01:04:27,547 --> 01:04:30,811
Here's Gargantua,
here's Miller's planet.

703
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:34,597
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit
around Miller's planet, which would...

704
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:37,443
conserve fuel, but
we'd lose a lot of time,

705
01:04:37,478 --> 01:04:39,838
what if, what if we take
a wider orbit around

706
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:42,016
Gargantua, parallel
with Miller's planet,

707
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,546
outside of it's time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

708
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,565
we get Miller, we get her samples, we
come back, we analyze, we debrief...

709
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,421
we're in, we're out, we lose a
little fuel. But we save a lot of time.

710
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,498
That'll work. -That's good.
- There's not gonna...

711
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:56,395
be time for monkey
business or chit-chat down

712
01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:58,340
there, so TARS, you should
definitely stay here.

713
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:02,135
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

714
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,591
If we are talking about
a couple of years,

715
01:05:04,786 --> 01:05:06,868
I could use the time
to research gravity,

716
01:05:07,013 --> 01:05:09,499
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

717
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:13,903
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

718
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:16,427
Make sure we stay in range from
Miller's planet. You got it?

719
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:19,759
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr.
Brand.

720
01:05:24,478 --> 01:05:28,101
You ready CASE? -Yep. -You
don't say much do you?

721
01:05:28,713 --> 01:05:33,009
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
- Detach.

722
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:43,187
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- Unbelievable.

723
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,622
A literal heart of darkness.

724
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:55,777
If we could just see the
collapsed star inside,

725
01:05:55,925 --> 01:05:58,798
the singularity,
we'd solve gravity.

726
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:02,265
We can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon,

727
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:06,317
not even light. All the answers
are there, just no way to see it.

728
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:07,827
There's Miller's planet.

729
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:11,395
Goodbye Ranger.

730
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:28,549
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

731
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:32,710
- No. I'm gonna use the Ranger's
aerodynamics to save some fuel.

732
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:35,849
Air-brake? -We wanna get
down fast don't we?

733
01:06:35,957 --> 01:06:39,352
Actually we wanna get there
in one piece. -Hang on.

734
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:41,110
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

735
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:59,677
We should be using the air-brake.
- Hands up CASE.

736
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:03,176
The only time I ever went down is when a
machine was easing at the wrong time.

737
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:06,406
You're going to get us killed.
- Just like reckless driving.

738
01:07:06,682 --> 01:07:08,323
We're too fast. -I got this.

739
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:17,126
Should I get ready to detach? -No.
I need to feel the air.

740
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:22,326
Here we go.

741
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:26,574
It's just water!

742
01:07:26,683 --> 01:07:31,430
The stuff of life. -1200 meters.

743
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,622
Do we have a fix on her beacon?
- That I have, can you maneuver?

744
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:37,094
I gonna need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna

745
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:39,534
spiral down on top of
it, everybody hang on!

746
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:42,855
700.

747
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:47,154
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

748
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:51,429
500 meters.

749
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:02,056
Now!

750
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:17,381
Very graceful.

751
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,873
No, but very efficient.

752
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:26,081
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

753
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:29,862
Go, go, go, go. 7
years per hour here.

754
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:31,262
Let's make it count.

755
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:58,449
This way.

756
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,055
About 200 meters.

757
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:17,664
Gravity's punishing. -Been
floating through space too long?

758
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:20,078
130% Earth's gravity.

759
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,834
Come on, come on, come on.

760
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:27,407
There's nothing here.
- should be right here.

761
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:32,537
If the, if the signal's
coming from here, then...

762
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:43,128
Her beacon.

763
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,360
Wreckage. -Where's the rest?

764
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,165
Towards the mountains.

765
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:01,533
Those aren't mountains.

766
01:10:04,048 --> 01:10:06,395
They're waves. -What?

767
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:11,372
Shit.

768
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:15,588
That one's moving away from us.

769
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:23,433
We need the recorder.

770
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,326
Brand, Doyle, back
to the Ranger now!

771
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,674
I'm not, leaving,
without, her data.

772
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:44,278
Get back here now. We do not have time.
The second wave is coming!

773
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:46,866
We are in the middle of a swell!

774
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:50,752
Get your ass back
to the Ranger now!

775
01:10:54,285 --> 01:10:57,591
Brand get back here now!!

776
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:02,937
Cooper, go, Cooper go,
I can't make it. Go!

777
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,270
CASE, go get her.

778
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,634
GO! -Get up, get up Brand.

779
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:13,494
Go go, go.

780
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:18,350
I'm not gonna make it! -Yes you are.
Yes you are!

781
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,573
Come on CASE has her, CASE has her!
Get back here Doyle!

782
01:11:30,346 --> 01:11:31,821
Dr. Brand.

783
01:11:33,515 --> 01:11:35,275
To the hatch.

784
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,302
Go, go. Go.

785
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:50,861
Manually overriding
inside hatch!

786
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:58,918
Cooper don't! Cooper don't!

787
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,152
Cooper!

788
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:05,848
Engines are flooded! I'll
have to shut it down!

789
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:40,644
Oh shit!!

790
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:46,761
Whoa!

791
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:21,064
CASE what's wrong? -Chute's
waterlogged, let it drain.

792
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:25,457
Goddamn it!! I told
you to leave me.

793
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,974
- And I told you to get
your ass back here!

794
01:13:28,048 --> 01:13:31,669
The difference is that one of us
was thinkin' about the mission.

795
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:33,619
- You were thinking
about getting home!!

796
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:39,614
I was trying to do the right thing!
- Can you tell that to Doyle?

797
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:44,504
CASE, how much time?
- 45 to an hour.

798
01:13:45,911 --> 01:13:47,626
The stuff of life huh?

799
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
- A lot.

800
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:53,493
Decades.

801
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,384
What happened to Miller?
- Judging by...

802
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:07,307
the wreckage she was broken
up by a wave soon after impact.

803
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:10,878
How's the hell the wreckage stayed
together after all these years, huh?

804
01:14:12,141 --> 01:14:13,722
Because of the time slippage.

805
01:14:13,869 --> 01:14:17,491
On this planet's time she,

806
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,624
she's landed hours ago, she...

807
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:22,653
she probably just
died minutes ago.

808
01:14:22,764 --> 01:14:26,609
The data Doyle received was just the
initial status echoing endlessly.

809
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,092
Oh we are not prepared for this.

810
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:35,784
You eggheads have the survival
skills of a boy-scout troop.

811
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:38,904
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

812
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:43,573
Well not far enough. And now we're stuck
here till there won't be anyone...

813
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:44,760
left on Earth to save.

814
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:50,242
I'm counting every minute
same as you Cooper.

815
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:58,875
Is there any possibility? I dunno,
maybe some way, I don't know...

816
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:03,000
maybe if we could jump in a black
hole and gain back the years?

817
01:15:03,502 --> 01:15:06,857
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

818
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,212
It can stretch and
it can squeeze, but,

819
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:13,031
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

820
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:17,300
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

821
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:20,939
Okay.

822
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:25,508
The beings that led us here,

823
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:28,712
they communicate through
gravity, right?

824
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:32,786
Could they be talking to us
from the future? -Maybe.

825
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:36,403
Okay, if they can..? They...

826
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:39,171
are beings of 5 dimensions!

827
01:15:39,288 --> 01:15:42,904
Right, to them, time might be
yet another physical dimension.

828
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:47,532
To them, the past might be a
canyon they can climb into,

829
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:52,360
and the future, a mountain that they can
climb up, but to us, it's not! Okay!

830
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:56,376
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

831
01:15:57,674 --> 01:15:59,721
But you knew about relativity.

832
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:03,533
Brand.

833
01:16:07,627 --> 01:16:10,586
My daughter is 10 years old.

834
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:13,962
Couldn't teach her Einstein's
theories before I left,

835
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:18,643
Couldn't you have told your daughter that
you were going to save the world? -No.

836
01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:24,476
When you become a parent, one
thing becomes really clear,

837
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,273
And that's you wanna make
sure your children feel safe,

838
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:34,101
and it rules out telling a 10 year
old, that the world's endin'.

839
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:37,421
Cooper.

840
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:44,543
How long for the engines CASE?
- A minute or two.

841
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:46,790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

842
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:55,283
Brand, co-pilot you're up. CASE, run the
cabin oxygen through the main thrusters.

843
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,346
We're gonna spark it!
- Roger that.

844
01:16:57,459 --> 01:16:58,658
Depressurizing.

845
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,172
Engines up!

846
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:38,086
Hello Rom! -I've waited years.

847
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:40,807
How many, how many years?

848
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:47,416
By now it must be, 23
years, 4 months, 8 days.

849
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,461
Doyle?

850
01:17:59,562 --> 01:18:02,914
I thought I was prepared... I
knew the theory...

851
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,501
reality is different.

852
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:07,518
And Miller?

853
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:10,548
There's nothing here for us.

854
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:18,077
Why didn't you sleep? -Oh I
had a couple of stretches.

855
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:21,037
I stopped believing that
you were coming back.

856
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:23,954
Something seemed wrong about
dreaming my life away.

857
01:18:24,023 --> 01:18:27,017
I learned what I could
from the black hole

858
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,488
but I couldn't send
anything to your father.

859
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
- Is he alive?

860
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:37,416
Oh, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah.

861
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,342
We've got years of messages stored.
- Cooper.

862
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:47,804
Messages span 23 years.

863
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,359
Play from the beginning.

864
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:59,551
Hey Dad, Just checkin'
in, sayin' hi.

865
01:19:00,856 --> 01:19:04,198
Umm, finished 2nd in school,

866
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:07,906
Miss Carlin's still
giving me Cs though,

867
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:11,213
pulled me down, but
second's not bad.

868
01:19:12,364 --> 01:19:14,631
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

869
01:19:16,227 --> 01:19:20,709
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

870
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:25,769
I uh, I really think
this is the one.

871
01:19:26,286 --> 01:19:28,901
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

872
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:34,195
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

873
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:37,971
She crashed it,
she's okay though.

874
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:42,838
Hey Dad. Look at this!

875
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:47,272
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

876
01:19:47,377 --> 01:19:52,528
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

877
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:55,103
And Donald says he's already
got the 'great' part so,

878
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:57,637
we're not to call him that.

879
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:04,755
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

880
01:20:04,861 --> 01:20:07,815
Goodbye grandpa.

881
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,725
Sorry, it's been a while.

882
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:17,016
It's..., what with
Jesse and all...

883
01:20:21,466 --> 01:20:25,776
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

884
01:20:25,883 --> 01:20:28,548
We buried him out in the
back 40 next to mom...

885
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:31,110
and Jesse.

886
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:37,018
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would've ever,... come back.

887
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,468
Murph was there at the funeral.

888
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:44,130
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

889
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,067
You're not listening
to this, I know.

890
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:58,606
All these messages are just,...
drifting...

891
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,977
out there in the darkness.

892
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:07,179
Lois says that, uh...
I have to let you go.

893
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:09,376
And uh...

894
01:21:10,688 --> 01:21:11,688
so...

895
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:18,026
I guess... I'll let you go.

896
01:21:19,076 --> 01:21:21,267
I don't know where you're dad.

897
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,941
But I hope that you're at peace.
And...

898
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:27,559
Goodbye.

899
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:42,220
Hey Dad.

900
01:21:45,284 --> 01:21:48,202
Hey Murph. -You son of a bitch!

901
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:54,899
I never made one of these when
you were still responding,

902
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,773
because I was so mad
at you for leaving.

903
01:21:59,175 --> 01:22:02,013
And then when you went quiet,

904
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,945
it felt like I should've lived
with that decision, and I have,

905
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:14,525
but today is my birthday,

906
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:21,562
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

907
01:22:24,499 --> 01:22:27,842
you once told me that
when you come back...

908
01:22:27,956 --> 01:22:29,869
we might be the same age.

909
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:34,753
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

910
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:41,019
So it would be a real good
time for you to come back!

911
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:55,660
I didn't mean to intrude,

912
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,525
It's just that I've
never seen you in here

913
01:22:58,537 --> 01:23:00,748
before. -Because I've never
been in here before.

914
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:07,580
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

915
01:23:07,731 --> 01:23:11,803
I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't.

916
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:16,282
Just had something which needed to get out.
- I know they're still out there.

917
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:16,685
I know.

918
01:23:16,802 --> 01:23:18,875
There are so many
reasons why our

919
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:21,646
communications might not
be getting through.

920
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,944
I know Professor.

921
01:23:23,058 --> 01:23:27,092
I'm not sure, what
I'm more afraid of.

922
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:30,200
Them never coming back or...

923
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:34,351
coming back to
find we've failed.

924
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:37,861
Then let's succeed. -So,

925
01:23:37,968 --> 01:23:42,867
back to the fourth iteration. Let's
run it through some new fields.

926
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:46,558
With respect Professor, we've
tried that hundreds of times.

927
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:50,189
- It only has to
work once, Murph.

928
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:56,844
Every rivet that they strike
could've been a bullet.

929
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:59,990
We've done well,
in the world here,

930
01:24:00,098 --> 01:24:04,155
whether or not we crack the
equation, before I kick the bucket.

931
01:24:04,268 --> 01:24:07,939
Don't be morbid Professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

932
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:09,810
I am an old physicist.

933
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:13,096
I'm afraid of time.

934
01:24:19,732 --> 01:24:21,434
Time.

935
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:25,449
You're afraid of time.

936
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,460
For years we've been trying to solve
the equation without changing...

937
01:24:30,547 --> 01:24:33,139
the underlying assumption
about time. -And?

938
01:24:33,293 --> 01:24:37,252
What it means, is each iteration is
an attempt to prove it's own proof,

939
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,200
it's recursive,...it's
nonsensical.

940
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:45,047
Are you calling my life's
work nonsense, Murph?

941
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:49,374
No, I'm saying that you've been
trying to finish it with one arm...

942
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:53,190
no, with both arms
tied behind your back.

943
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,212
And I don't understand why.

944
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:59,115
I am an old man Murph.

945
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:02,751
Can we take this point
up at another time?

946
01:25:02,862 --> 01:25:04,914
I want to talk to my daughter.

947
01:25:06,429 --> 01:25:09,810
Stepping out into the universe,

948
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:14,050
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

949
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:18,296
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

950
01:25:19,557 --> 01:25:22,304
We must think, not
as individuals,

951
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:24,614
but as a species.

952
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:30,937
'Do not go gentle into
that good night.'

953
01:25:31,486 --> 01:25:34,588
TARS kept the Endurance right
where we needed her...

954
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:37,398
but the trip took years
longer than what we anticipated.

955
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,334
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both our prospects,

956
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,993
so, we've got to choose.

957
01:25:44,648 --> 01:25:45,648
But how?

958
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:48,076
They're both promising.

959
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,769
And Edmunds data is better,

960
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,553
but Dr. Mann is the one who's
still transmitting. So...

961
01:25:54,663 --> 01:25:57,474
We've got no reason to suspect
Edmunds data would've soured.

962
01:25:58,592 --> 01:26:02,804
His world has key elements to sustain
human life. -As does Dr. Mann's.

963
01:26:02,877 --> 01:26:04,245
Cooper, this is my field.

964
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:10,245
And I really believe Edmund's
is the better prospect. -Why?

965
01:26:10,358 --> 01:26:15,350
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

966
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:19,654
Hydrocarbons, organics,
yes; But no life. Sterile.

967
01:26:19,668 --> 01:26:24,511
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
- Because of the black hole?

968
01:26:24,587 --> 01:26:28,087
- Murphy's Law. Whatever
can happen, will happen.

969
01:26:28,195 --> 01:26:30,865
Accidents are the first
building block of evolution,

970
01:26:31,017 --> 01:26:34,398
but when you're orbiting a black
hole, not enough can happen,

971
01:26:34,513 --> 01:26:38,378
it sucks in asteroids, comets, other
events which would otherwise reach you.

972
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:39,767
We need to go further afield.

973
01:26:40,516 --> 01:26:46,301
You once said that Dr.
Mann, was the best of us.

974
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:50,058
He is remarkable. we're
only here because of him.

975
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:53,440
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

976
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:58,209
and he's sending a very unambiguous
message, telling us to come to his planet.

977
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:03,954
- Granted. But Edmund's
data is more promising.

978
01:27:04,027 --> 01:27:04,967
We should vote.

979
01:27:04,979 --> 01:27:07,834
Well, if we're going to vote,
there's something you should know,

980
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:11,447
Brand, he has a right to know.

981
01:27:11,521 --> 01:27:14,953
That has nothing to do with it.
- What does?

982
01:27:15,066 --> 01:27:18,210
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
- Is that true?

983
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:19,545
Yes.

984
01:27:22,293 --> 01:27:25,460
And that makes me want
to follow my heart.

985
01:27:28,633 --> 01:27:32,678
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory,

986
01:27:32,756 --> 01:27:35,881
- You're a scientist Brand.
- So listen to me,

987
01:27:35,996 --> 01:27:40,640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

988
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:44,314
observable, powerful.

989
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:50,933
It has to mean something. -Love has
meaning, yes, social utility...

990
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:54,521
social bonding, child rearing,
- We love people who have died,

991
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:58,565
where's the social utility in that?
- None.

992
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:01,473
- Maybe it means something
more, something we can't...

993
01:28:01,546 --> 01:28:04,566
yet understand.

994
01:28:04,633 --> 01:28:07,977
Maybe it's, some
evidence, some...

995
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:13,626
artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

996
01:28:13,749 --> 01:28:16,651
I'm drawn across the
universe to someone...

997
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:21,351
I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

998
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,485
Love is the one thing
we're capable...

999
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:27,778
of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

1000
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:32,107
Maybe we should trust that,

1001
01:28:32,178 --> 01:28:35,110
even if we can't
understand it yet.

1002
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:40,821
Alright Cooper,

1003
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:44,238
Yes!

1004
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:48,895
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

1005
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:53,843
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
- Honestly Amelia,

1006
01:28:55,757 --> 01:28:57,122
it might.

1007
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:06,615
TARS, chart a course for Dr.
Mann's.

1008
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:27,287
We'll lose about a third again.
Next year. Next year,

1009
01:29:27,299 --> 01:29:31,891
I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and I'm gonna make it up.

1010
01:29:32,004 --> 01:29:33,910
What happened to Nelson?

1011
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:42,257
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like

1012
01:29:42,269 --> 01:29:44,608
some more Soufflé? -No, I'm full.
Thanks.

1013
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:45,719
It was delicious.

1014
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,426
Hand me that donut please.

1015
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:54,993
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. It's...

1016
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:55,910
I need to get back.

1017
01:29:55,922 --> 01:29:58,379
My sewing machine is in
there, but there's plenty...

1018
01:29:58,449 --> 01:30:01,454
-I need to...

1019
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:07,037
too many memories. -Well,
we have something for that.

1020
01:30:15,812 --> 01:30:16,915
Dust.

1021
01:30:18,535 --> 01:30:21,811
Lois, I have a
friend who could...

1022
01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:24,080
look at his lungs.

1023
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,263
Amelia, I'm sorry. -You're
just being objective.

1024
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:48,530
Unless you're punishing me, for
screwing up on Miller's planet,

1025
01:30:48,733 --> 01:30:50,737
- No, this wasn't a
personal decision.

1026
01:30:50,813 --> 01:30:55,272
Well, if you're wrong, you have a
very personal decision to make.

1027
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:59,415
Your fuel calculations are
based on a return journey.

1028
01:30:59,524 --> 01:31:02,464
Strike out on Mann's planet and
you'll have to decide whether...

1029
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:06,026
to return home, or push
onto Edmunds with plan B.

1030
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:09,999
Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.

1031
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:12,853
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1032
01:31:12,964 --> 01:31:14,901
or the future of the human race.

1033
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:17,973
I trust you'll be
as objective then.

1034
01:31:24,122 --> 01:31:27,397
He has been asking for
you since he came to.

1035
01:31:27,472 --> 01:31:28,770
We were trying to reach you.

1036
01:31:34,461 --> 01:31:38,155
Murph? -Hey. I'm here Professor.

1037
01:31:38,264 --> 01:31:41,644
I think I let all down.

1038
01:31:41,758 --> 01:31:44,820
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

1039
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:48,399
I will finish what you started.

1040
01:31:48,513 --> 01:31:51,630
Good, good Murph.

1041
01:31:51,744 --> 01:31:55,938
You had faith.

1042
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:01,484
All those, all those years,

1043
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,483
I asked you to have faith,

1044
01:32:07,609 --> 01:32:15,609
I wanted you to believe, that
your father,... would come back.

1045
01:32:19,032 --> 01:32:20,903
I do Professor.

1046
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:26,559
Forgive me Murph. -There's
nothing to forgive.

1047
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:33,286
I lied Murph,

1048
01:32:34,405 --> 01:32:36,716
I lied to you.

1049
01:32:42,441 --> 01:32:49,399
There was no need for
him, to come back.

1050
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:55,786
There's no way to help us.

1051
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:59,193
But the Plan A? All this?

1052
01:33:00,029 --> 01:33:04,570
All these people.
And the equation?

1053
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,881
Did my father know?

1054
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,383
Did he leave me?

1055
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:26,050
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

1056
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:34,176
No. NO!

1057
01:33:34,294 --> 01:33:38,595
You can't leave. NO!!

1058
01:33:38,705 --> 01:33:42,801
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1059
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:46,007
He didn't feel any pain.
He was at peace.

1060
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,854
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1061
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:03,637
Brand did you know?

1062
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:07,431
He told you right?

1063
01:34:09,032 --> 01:34:11,692
You knew?

1064
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:15,191
This was all a sham.

1065
01:34:19,826 --> 01:34:21,444
You left us here.

1066
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,263
To suffocate.

1067
01:34:26,522 --> 01:34:28,354
To starve.

1068
01:34:55,363 --> 01:34:57,534
Frozen cloud.

1069
01:37:21,492 --> 01:37:24,756
It's okay.

1070
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:33,026
It's okay.

1071
01:37:33,144 --> 01:37:35,086
It's okay.

1072
01:37:37,882 --> 01:37:40,167
Pray you never learn,

1073
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:44,522
just how good it can be
to see another face.

1074
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:57,997
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1075
01:37:59,727 --> 01:38:02,460
My supplies were
completely exhausted.

1076
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:08,535
The last time I went to sleep, I
didn't even set up a waking date.

1077
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:14,993
You've literally raised
me from the dead.

1078
01:38:16,008 --> 01:38:17,228
Lazarus.

1079
01:38:18,384 --> 01:38:22,372
What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it sir.

1080
01:38:23,385 --> 01:38:25,302
So far, surely.

1081
01:38:25,878 --> 01:38:28,556
No. In our present situation...

1082
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,363
there's very little chance
of rescuing any others.

1083
01:38:34,452 --> 01:38:35,873
Dr. Mann.

1084
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:39,508
Dr. Mann, tell us
about your world.

1085
01:38:42,702 --> 01:38:44,757
Our world, we hope...

1086
01:38:47,146 --> 01:38:55,146
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

1087
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:01,488
The days are 67
hours long, cold.

1088
01:39:05,378 --> 01:39:09,297
The nights are 67
far colder hours.

1089
01:39:14,302 --> 01:39:20,217
The gravity is a very, very
pleasant 80% of the Earth's.

1090
01:39:20,331 --> 01:39:23,502
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

1091
01:39:23,619 --> 01:39:27,316
And the air has too much ammonia in it to
breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1092
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:31,996
But, down at the surface,
and there is, a surface,

1093
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:36,643
the chlorine dissipates, the ammonia
gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1094
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:39,486
Breathable air, to organics.

1095
01:39:39,596 --> 01:39:42,333
Possibly even, to life.

1096
01:39:42,414 --> 01:39:45,258
We might be sharing this world.

1097
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,654
These readings are
from the surface?

1098
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:52,487
Over the years, I've dropped various
probes. -How far have you explored?

1099
01:39:52,596 --> 01:39:55,547
I have managed several major
expeditions, but with oxygen in...

1100
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:58,082
limited supply, KIPP
there, really did most

1101
01:39:58,094 --> 01:40:00,567
of the legwork. -What
went wrong with him sir?

1102
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:03,471
Degeneration. He misidentified
the first organics...

1103
01:40:03,472 --> 01:40:08,436
we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

1104
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:10,560
ultimately I
decommissioned him, used his

1105
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:12,405
power source to keep
the mission going.

1106
01:40:12,594 --> 01:40:14,603
I thought I was alone
before I even shut him

1107
01:40:14,615 --> 01:40:16,770
down. -Would you like me
to take a look at him?

1108
01:40:16,842 --> 01:40:20,190
No, no, needs a human touch.

1109
01:40:20,262 --> 01:40:22,511
Dr. Brand, CASE is
relaying a message...

1110
01:40:22,512 --> 01:40:26,800
for you, from the spaceship.
- Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

1111
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:42,392
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1112
01:40:42,505 --> 01:40:48,199
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1113
01:40:50,516 --> 01:40:52,501
I'm sorry for your loss.

1114
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,714
Is that Murph?
- She's,...she's grown!

1115
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:00,798
Brand did you know?

1116
01:41:02,206 --> 01:41:03,721
He told you right?

1117
01:41:06,063 --> 01:41:08,073
You knew?

1118
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:13,851
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1119
01:41:15,006 --> 01:41:17,669
To suffocate.

1120
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,070
To starve.

1121
01:41:24,777 --> 01:41:26,330
Did my father know too?

1122
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:29,789
Dad!

1123
01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:37,997
I just want to know, if
you left me here to die?

1124
01:41:39,157 --> 01:41:42,080
I just have to know!

1125
01:41:47,197 --> 01:41:55,197
Cooper, my father dedicated his
whole life to plan A, I have...

1126
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:58,131
no idea what she's
talking about.

1127
01:41:59,217 --> 01:42:00,702
I do.

1128
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:09,017
He, he never even hoped to get
the people off the Earth?

1129
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,708
No.

1130
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:18,991
But he has been trying to solve the
gravity equation for 40 years.

1131
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:23,312
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1132
01:42:23,386 --> 01:42:25,302
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1133
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:29,878
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics You need more.

1134
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,574
More? More what? -More data. You
need to see into a black hole.

1135
01:42:34,575 --> 01:42:38,715
The laws of nature prohibit a naked
singularity. -Romilly, is that true?

1136
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:43,793
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1137
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,213
The gravity is so strong
that it is always hidden...

1138
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:48,045
in darkness, beyond the horizon.

1139
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:51,366
That's why we call
it a 'black' hole.

1140
01:42:51,475 --> 01:42:55,700
Okay,...what if we see
beyond the horizon?

1141
01:42:55,775 --> 01:42:59,862
We can't Cooper. -There are some
things that aren't meant to be known.

1142
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:04,397
Your father had to find another way to
save the human race from extinction.

1143
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,964
Plan B, a colony. -But
why not tell people?

1144
01:43:09,413 --> 01:43:10,793
Why keep it from us?

1145
01:43:10,907 --> 01:43:13,283
Because he knew how hard it
would be to get people...

1146
01:43:13,284 --> 01:43:18,282
to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1147
01:43:18,387 --> 01:43:19,471
Bullshit!

1148
01:43:19,579 --> 01:43:22,324
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1149
01:43:22,438 --> 01:43:25,198
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

1150
01:43:25,272 --> 01:43:29,482
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

1151
01:43:29,553 --> 01:43:33,911
But that empathy rarely extends beyond
our line of sight. -But the lie?

1152
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:41,839
That monstrous lie?
- Unforgivable.

1153
01:43:41,951 --> 01:43:46,738
And he knew that. He was prepared
to destroy his own humanity,

1154
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:50,342
in order to save the species, he
made an incredible sacrifice.

1155
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:54,950
NO! No, an incredible
sacrifice is being made,

1156
01:43:55,025 --> 01:43:57,929
by the people on Earth
who're gonna die!

1157
01:43:57,936 --> 01:44:02,581
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

1158
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:07,145
I'm sorry Cooper, their
case is hopeless.

1159
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:11,413
No. No. -We are the future.

1160
01:44:12,852 --> 01:44:14,073
Cooper.

1161
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:16,752
Cooper, what I can do?

1162
01:44:19,635 --> 01:44:21,509
Let me go home.

1163
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,679
You're absolutely positive?

1164
01:44:24,792 --> 01:44:29,297
His solution was correct. He's had
it for years. -It's worthless?

1165
01:44:29,368 --> 01:44:30,999
It's half the answer.

1166
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:35,132
Okay, how do you
find the other half?

1167
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:38,384
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1168
01:44:38,493 --> 01:44:40,007
Yeah?

1169
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:42,744
I'm not sure you can.

1170
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:47,589
God, they just
pack up and leave.

1171
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:52,976
What're they hoping to find?
- Survival.

1172
01:45:00,224 --> 01:45:01,555
Damn it!

1173
01:45:04,623 --> 01:45:08,469
Murph, don't, don't people
have the right to know?

1174
01:45:08,587 --> 01:45:13,010
Panic won't help. We just have
to keep working, same as ever.

1175
01:45:13,081 --> 01:45:16,300
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1176
01:45:16,408 --> 01:45:19,723
- Brand gave up on us. I'm
still trying to solve this.

1177
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:24,245
So, do you have an idea?

1178
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:26,906
A feeling.

1179
01:45:29,427 --> 01:45:31,849
I told you about my ghost.

1180
01:45:33,404 --> 01:45:37,952
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1181
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,491
But I was never scared of it.

1182
01:45:44,467 --> 01:45:52,205
I called it a ghost because
it felt....like a person,

1183
01:45:53,969 --> 01:45:56,814
that was trying to
tell me something.

1184
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,184
If there is an answer here
on Earth, it's back there,

1185
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:06,502
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1186
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,978
We're running out of time.

1187
01:46:13,024 --> 01:46:16,154
What about auxiliary
oxygen scrubbers?

1188
01:46:16,261 --> 01:46:19,922
They can stay CASE. I'll be sleeping most
of the way anyway. -Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1189
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:23,474
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
- What is that?

1190
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:25,459
Have one last crack
at the black hole.

1191
01:46:26,767 --> 01:46:30,269
I'm going home Rom.
- Yeah I know.

1192
01:46:30,376 --> 01:46:35,033
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1193
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:38,877
Talk to me. -Gargantua is an
older spinning black hole.

1194
01:46:38,985 --> 01:46:42,200
It is what we call a 'gentle'
singularity. -Gentle?

1195
01:46:42,322 --> 01:46:46,718
They're hardly gentle. But the tidal
gravity is so quick that something...

1196
01:46:46,825 --> 01:46:51,105
crossing the horizon fast,
might survive. A probe say.

1197
01:46:51,177 --> 01:46:52,657
What happens after it crosses?

1198
01:46:52,736 --> 01:46:55,618
After, the horizon, is
a complete mystery.

1199
01:46:55,691 --> 01:46:58,487
So, what's to say that there isn't
some way that the probe can...

1200
01:46:58,488 --> 01:47:01,412
glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1201
01:47:01,542 --> 01:47:05,564
If he's equipped to transmit every
form of energy that can pulse...

1202
01:47:05,653 --> 01:47:10,508
Just when did this probe become a 'he'
professor? -TARS is the obvious candidate.

1203
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,225
I've already told him
what to look for.

1204
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:17,555
I'll need the old optical transmitter on
KIPP, Cooper. -You would do this for us?

1205
01:47:17,663 --> 01:47:20,504
Before you get all teary, try
to remember that as a robot...

1206
01:47:20,578 --> 01:47:24,190
I have to do anything you say.
- Your cue light's blinking.

1207
01:47:24,264 --> 01:47:25,680
I'm not joking!

1208
01:47:28,304 --> 01:47:33,029
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and
adapt some components from KIPP.

1209
01:47:33,099 --> 01:47:36,682
Well, I don't wanna disturb his
archival functions. -I'll supervise.

1210
01:47:36,792 --> 01:47:40,971
Alright. -Dr. Mann, we need
to find 3 secure sites.

1211
01:47:41,051 --> 01:47:43,314
One for Brand's lab
and 2 for habitat.

1212
01:47:43,428 --> 01:47:45,977
Once those modules have
landed, you don't wanna move.

1213
01:47:46,077 --> 01:47:48,234
Well I can take you to the probes
sites, but I don't think this...

1214
01:47:48,349 --> 01:47:51,263
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1215
01:47:51,374 --> 01:47:54,256
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1216
01:47:54,339 --> 01:47:56,927
I would really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

1217
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:02,437
Well, these squalls
do usually blow over.

1218
01:48:02,515 --> 01:48:05,609
Okay then. -You're gonna have to
take a long-range transmitter.

1219
01:48:05,723 --> 01:48:07,499
Right. -Are you charged? -Yeah.

1220
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:08,995
Follow me.

1221
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:13,804
TARS, 72 hours yeah?
- Roger that Cooper.

1222
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:23,033
Brand told me why you feel
you've got to go back.

1223
01:48:23,847 --> 01:48:28,625
But I'd be remiss if didn't at
least mention that a mission...

1224
01:48:28,697 --> 01:48:31,862
such as ours could certainly
do with an extra engineer.

1225
01:48:33,322 --> 01:48:35,666
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1226
01:48:35,778 --> 01:48:40,717
Safety first CASE, do not forget.
- Safety first Cooper.

1227
01:48:40,795 --> 01:48:45,256
I have to tell you Dr. Mann I'm
honored to be a part of this.

1228
01:48:45,369 --> 01:48:47,527
But once we set up
base camp and...

1229
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:51,992
secure those modules, my work
is done here. I'm going home.

1230
01:48:59,829 --> 01:49:01,556
We have attachments.

1231
01:49:01,632 --> 01:49:05,918
But even without a family, I can,
promise you that, that yearning...

1232
01:49:06,024 --> 01:49:08,505
to be with other
people is remarkable.

1233
01:49:08,538 --> 01:49:14,581
That emotion is, at the foundation,
of what makes us human.

1234
01:49:23,266 --> 01:49:26,925
How long have you had that cough?
- For a while.

1235
01:49:36,857 --> 01:49:39,156
Mom let me play in here.

1236
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:42,034
I don't touch your stuff.

1237
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,733
Just take this gently.

1238
01:50:20,161 --> 01:50:23,619
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you Cooper?

1239
01:50:23,733 --> 01:50:28,709
A machine doesn't improvise well, because
you can't programme the fear of death.

1240
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:33,345
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

1241
01:50:33,455 --> 01:50:35,447
Take you for example,

1242
01:50:36,341 --> 01:50:41,499
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1243
01:50:41,622 --> 01:50:46,965
What does research tell us, is the last
thing you're gonna see, before you die?

1244
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:51,798
Your children. Their faces.

1245
01:50:51,875 --> 01:50:53,867
At the moment of death,
your mind is going

1246
01:50:53,879 --> 01:50:55,976
to push you a little bit
harder, to survive.

1247
01:50:56,057 --> 01:50:59,642
For them.

1248
01:51:01,737 --> 01:51:05,759
Hey, I bet you're Coop. Why don't
you have a seat here for me.

1249
01:51:05,886 --> 01:51:08,328
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

1250
01:51:08,687 --> 01:51:10,462
OK? -Yes.

1251
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:22,881
TARS, what's taking so long? -Professor,
I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1252
01:51:22,992 --> 01:51:24,782
I don't understand?

1253
01:51:31,562 --> 01:51:32,755
It's funny.

1254
01:51:34,727 --> 01:51:39,790
When I left Earth, I thought
I was prepared to die.

1255
01:51:40,764 --> 01:51:48,044
The truth is, I never
really, considered...

1256
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:50,455
the possibility that
my planet wasn't the one.

1257
01:51:52,567 --> 01:51:56,659
Nothing turns out the way it's
supposed to be. -Let's go.

1258
01:52:02,313 --> 01:52:04,891
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

1259
01:52:13,002 --> 01:52:15,218
What is this? -What
are you doing??

1260
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,683
I'm sorry, I can't let you
leave with that ship.

1261
01:52:18,765 --> 01:52:21,420
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1262
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:26,527
Once the others, realize what this
place isn't. We cannot survive here.

1263
01:52:26,604 --> 01:52:28,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1264
01:52:38,981 --> 01:52:40,299
They can't stay here anymore.

1265
01:52:40,373 --> 01:52:43,995
You have to leave, right now. Hey buddy,
let me make something abundantly clear...

1266
01:52:44,071 --> 01:52:46,837
You have a responsibility.
- Shit.

1267
01:52:46,949 --> 01:52:49,543
Coop, get her stuff,
she's goin' home.

1268
01:52:49,653 --> 01:52:51,723
- Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb Tom!

1269
01:52:51,802 --> 01:52:54,099
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa
did, and he's buried...

1270
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:55,614
out back with mom and Jesse.

1271
01:52:55,649 --> 01:53:03,649
All the data?

1272
01:53:07,177 --> 01:53:12,009
No. I tried to do
my duty Cooper.

1273
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:16,932
But I knew, the day that I arrived
here, this place had nothing...

1274
01:53:17,008 --> 01:53:21,289
and I resisted the
temptation, for years

1275
01:53:21,364 --> 01:53:25,059
But, I knew that, if
I just pressed that

1276
01:53:25,071 --> 01:53:29,320
button, then, somebody
would come and save me.

1277
01:53:30,446 --> 01:53:33,825
You fucking coward! -Yes.

1278
01:53:38,806 --> 01:53:40,208
Yes.

1279
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:43,129
Yes.

1280
01:53:44,135 --> 01:53:45,135
Yes.

1281
01:53:56,932 --> 01:54:01,685
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your
family go. Just let,...save your family.

1282
01:54:01,717 --> 01:54:06,574
And go to live underground? With you?
Pray that daddy comes to save us?

1283
01:54:06,644 --> 01:54:10,569
Dad's not coming back. He never
was coming back. It's upto me!

1284
01:54:10,613 --> 01:54:13,176
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad

1285
01:54:13,188 --> 01:54:15,477
couldn't do it? -DAD
DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!

1286
01:54:15,597 --> 01:54:17,293
Dad just abandoned us!!

1287
01:54:18,483 --> 01:54:22,733
He left us here to die.
- Nobody is going with you.

1288
01:54:26,618 --> 01:54:28,822
You're gonna wait for
your next kid to die?

1289
01:54:31,851 --> 01:54:35,745
Get out, and don't come back!

1290
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:42,352
Do what you want
with those things.

1291
01:54:53,037 --> 01:54:54,740
Stop it!

1292
01:54:56,510 --> 01:54:59,061
No. NO!

1293
01:54:59,998 --> 01:55:03,347
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance
that you're gonna kill yourselves.

1294
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:06,156
Those are the best odds
I've had in years!

1295
01:55:26,209 --> 01:55:31,041
Don't judge me Cooper. You
were never tested like I was.

1296
01:55:31,486 --> 01:55:33,414
Few men have been.

1297
01:55:41,704 --> 01:55:43,400
You tried your best Murph.

1298
01:55:52,209 --> 01:55:54,123
Do you feel it?

1299
01:55:55,133 --> 01:55:57,431
The survival instinct.

1300
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:03,011
That's what drove me. It's what drives all
of us, and it's what's gonna save us.

1301
01:56:03,087 --> 01:56:06,843
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1302
01:56:11,963 --> 01:56:15,979
I'm sorry, I can't, I can't watch
you go through this. I'm sorry.

1303
01:56:16,055 --> 01:56:18,324
I thought I could, but I can't.

1304
01:56:19,589 --> 01:56:22,054
I'm here, I'm here for you.

1305
01:56:22,161 --> 01:56:25,953
Just listen to my voice
Cooper, I'm right here.

1306
01:56:27,078 --> 01:56:29,709
You're not alone.

1307
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:41,049
Do you see your children?

1308
01:56:43,537 --> 01:56:47,661
It's okay. They are
right there with you.

1309
01:56:51,522 --> 01:56:54,802
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

1310
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,606
Do you remember?

1311
01:56:57,833 --> 01:57:02,300
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

1312
01:57:02,413 --> 01:57:08,129
'Old age should burn, and
rave at close of day.'

1313
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:12,821
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

1314
01:57:37,233 --> 01:57:40,127
Help! Help! -Cooper?

1315
01:57:47,045 --> 01:57:49,864
CASE! -Brand.

1316
01:57:50,818 --> 01:57:51,818
No air!

1317
01:57:53,726 --> 01:57:57,174
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have a fix.

1318
01:57:57,256 --> 01:57:59,590
Go, go, go!!

1319
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:14,178
Cooper we're coming, hang
in there, don't talk!

1320
01:58:14,251 --> 01:58:16,762
Breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there!

1321
01:58:19,774 --> 01:58:22,244
There is a security lockout
sir, it requires...

1322
01:58:22,326 --> 01:58:25,017
a person to access
the functions.

1323
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:32,784
It's all yours sir.

1324
01:58:49,163 --> 01:58:50,163
Cooper!!

1325
01:58:53,788 --> 01:58:56,163
Come on!

1326
01:59:02,387 --> 01:59:06,816
I see him! I see him! To the right.
Bank right!

1327
01:59:24,848 --> 01:59:28,107
Cooper! Cooper, I'm here.

1328
01:59:33,653 --> 01:59:34,672
Take this!

1329
01:59:42,514 --> 01:59:44,203
Joey bring the tankers!

1330
01:59:50,785 --> 01:59:53,122
This data makes no sense.

1331
02:00:00,742 --> 02:00:04,275
I'm sorry. -What?

1332
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:06,233
Mann, was lying!

1333
02:00:16,014 --> 02:00:18,927
Romilly!

1334
02:00:19,036 --> 02:00:22,324
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!!

1335
02:00:22,433 --> 02:00:24,207
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!!
STEP BACK!!

1336
02:00:31,572 --> 02:00:34,849
Romilly. -Romilly!
Do you read me?!!

1337
02:00:37,203 --> 02:00:38,821
Keep watch!

1338
02:00:39,973 --> 02:00:43,598
Lois! -What happened
to caution CASE?

1339
02:00:43,676 --> 02:00:45,041
Safety first Cooper.

1340
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:48,860
Romilly, Romilly do you read me?
This is Brand.

1341
02:00:51,627 --> 02:00:55,680
Romilly! -Dr. Brand, Cooper,
there's been an explosion.

1342
02:00:55,794 --> 02:00:57,728
Dr. Mann's compound.

1343
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,562
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

1344
02:01:34,045 --> 02:01:36,006
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1345
02:01:39,571 --> 02:01:41,336
Romilly did not survive.

1346
02:01:42,563 --> 02:01:46,448
I could not save him. -TARS is in.
- I'll take it from here!

1347
02:01:46,559 --> 02:01:48,945
Do you have a fix on the Ranger?
- He is pushing into orbit.

1348
02:01:49,058 --> 02:01:52,272
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1349
02:01:53,503 --> 02:01:56,751
He'd maroon us? -He
is marooning us!

1350
02:01:58,084 --> 02:02:01,677
Get downstairs. Go
wait by the car.

1351
02:02:08,397 --> 02:02:12,277
Come on. Get in the back!

1352
02:02:12,346 --> 02:02:13,426
Get in the back seat, now!!

1353
02:02:18,537 --> 02:02:23,222
Dr. Mann please respond! Dr.
Mann please respond!!

1354
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:27,333
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking
procedure. -But the autopilot does.

1355
02:02:27,446 --> 02:02:31,220
Not since TARS disabled it!
- Nice!

1356
02:02:31,293 --> 02:02:34,104
What is your trust setting TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently!

1357
02:02:38,955 --> 02:02:42,024
Do not attempt docking, I
repeat do not attempt docking.

1358
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:44,111
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1359
02:03:44,148 --> 02:03:48,461
Override. -Unauthorized.
- Override!

1360
02:03:48,537 --> 02:03:50,665
Unauthorized.

1361
02:03:55,076 --> 02:03:59,717
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not!
Attempt docking! Please resp...

1362
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:45,163
Moving slowly towards
the Endurance.

1363
02:05:09,451 --> 02:05:13,791
Imperfect contact. -Override!
- Hatch locked.

1364
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:23,649
Has he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

1365
02:05:25,683 --> 02:05:27,368
Dr. Mann...

1366
02:05:48,024 --> 02:05:50,978
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1367
02:05:59,899 --> 02:06:03,785
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat,
do not open the hatch.

1368
02:06:03,858 --> 02:06:06,313
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open

1369
02:06:06,325 --> 02:06:08,628
the hatch, the airlock
will depressurize.

1370
02:06:34,072 --> 02:06:37,087
What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

1371
02:06:42,841 --> 02:06:47,128
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters
full move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!

1372
02:06:47,381 --> 02:06:50,151
CASE relay my message to
the onboard computer...

1373
02:06:50,265 --> 02:06:51,769
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency PA.

1374
02:06:51,804 --> 02:06:57,687
Dr. Mann, do not
open the air hatch.

1375
02:06:57,796 --> 02:07:00,098
I repeat, do not... -Brand?

1376
02:07:00,170 --> 02:07:05,141
I don't know what he said to you? But
I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1377
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:07,993
And then we're gonna talk
about completing the mission.

1378
02:07:10,512 --> 02:07:13,352
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

1379
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:17,315
This is not about my
life, or Cooper's life,

1380
02:07:17,422 --> 02:07:19,194
This is about all mankind.

1381
02:07:20,283 --> 02:07:21,313
There is a moment...

1382
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:29,121
It is not...

1383
02:07:37,259 --> 02:07:38,945
Oh, my God.

1384
02:07:56,853 --> 02:08:02,597
Cooper there's no point in using your
fuel... -Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1385
02:08:06,674 --> 02:08:09,481
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

1386
02:08:12,353 --> 02:08:15,530
Computer says rotation
at 67, 68 rpm.

1387
02:08:15,603 --> 02:08:19,747
Get ready to match our spin with the
retro thrusters. -It's not possible.

1388
02:08:19,829 --> 02:08:21,875
-No, it's necessary.

1389
02:08:32,953 --> 02:08:35,651
The Endurance is
entering the atmosphere.

1390
02:08:39,879 --> 02:08:41,503
It does not have a heat shield.

1391
02:08:43,953 --> 02:08:46,610
CASE, you ready? -Ready.

1392
02:08:54,979 --> 02:08:57,798
Cooper, this is no
time for caution.

1393
02:08:59,565 --> 02:09:01,581
CASE, if I pass out,
you take the stick.

1394
02:09:01,693 --> 02:09:05,182
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1395
02:09:11,571 --> 02:09:15,011
The Endurance is starting to heat.
- 20 feet out.

1396
02:09:15,093 --> 02:09:18,940
I need three degrees starboard Cooper.
- 10 feet out.

1397
02:09:19,049 --> 02:09:22,581
Cooper, we are, lined up!

1398
02:09:22,697 --> 02:09:24,093
Initiate spin!

1399
02:10:05,997 --> 02:10:07,286
Hold on TARS!

1400
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:16,390
HOLD ON!

1401
02:10:26,858 --> 02:10:30,323
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

1402
02:10:37,567 --> 02:10:39,665
Slowly.

1403
02:10:40,692 --> 02:10:41,945
Slowly.

1404
02:10:47,219 --> 02:10:49,160
Retro thrusters!

1405
02:10:56,663 --> 02:10:58,948
Main engines on!

1406
02:11:04,061 --> 02:11:07,545
We're getting out of orbit.
Come on baby!

1407
02:11:15,121 --> 02:11:16,747
Shutting engines.

1408
02:11:17,825 --> 02:11:19,813
Okay we're out of orbit!

1409
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:30,616
Okay! And for our next trick!

1410
02:11:31,554 --> 02:11:35,703
It better be good. We're
headed into Gargantua's pull.

1411
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:40,213
Shit. CASE take the stick.
- Roger that.

1412
02:12:29,345 --> 02:12:32,253
Cooper, we're slipping
towards Gargantua.

1413
02:12:32,401 --> 02:12:34,924
Shall I use the engines?

1414
02:12:35,036 --> 02:12:39,348
No, we gotta let her
slide as far as we can!

1415
02:12:48,609 --> 02:12:51,433
Give it to me. -It's good
news and bad news Cooper.

1416
02:12:51,543 --> 02:12:55,433
Yeah, to hell with it TARS!
Just give it to me straight.

1417
02:13:03,067 --> 02:13:07,104
The back-up generator kicked in, so the
system's stable. They're all good.

1418
02:13:08,274 --> 02:13:12,491
Good! Okay. The navigational
hub's been completely destroyed.

1419
02:13:12,599 --> 02:13:15,216
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth,

1420
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:19,229
but I think we can scratch over to
Edmund's planet. -What about fuel?

1421
02:13:19,339 --> 02:13:22,042
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1422
02:13:22,081 --> 02:13:25,595
We let, Gargantua,
pull us down close...

1423
02:13:25,598 --> 02:13:28,729
to the horizon, and a
powered slingshot...

1424
02:13:28,848 --> 02:13:31,503
around launching us towards
Edmund's planet. -Manually?

1425
02:13:31,615 --> 02:13:35,282
That's what I'm here for. I'll take
us just inside the critical orbit.

1426
02:13:35,357 --> 02:13:36,865
What about the time slippage?

1427
02:13:36,979 --> 02:13:40,472
Neither one of us have time to worry
about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1428
02:13:45,075 --> 02:13:46,075
Sorry Cooper.

1429
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:51,330
Once we have gathered
enough speed...

1430
02:13:51,402 --> 02:13:54,454
around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

1431
02:13:54,953 --> 02:13:57,590
and Ranger 2 as
rocket boosters...

1432
02:13:57,847 --> 02:14:00,512
to push us out of the
black hole's gravity

1433
02:14:02,064 --> 02:14:04,904
The Lander's linkages
have been destroyed,

1434
02:14:04,981 --> 02:14:07,970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1435
02:14:09,447 --> 02:14:12,725
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1436
02:14:12,834 --> 02:14:17,052
and get sucked right into that black
hole! -Why does TARS have to detach?

1437
02:14:17,163 --> 02:14:21,651
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
- Newton's third law.

1438
02:14:21,727 --> 02:14:23,829
The only way humans have
figured out of getting

1439
02:14:23,841 --> 02:14:25,603
somewhere is to leave
something behind.

1440
02:14:25,759 --> 02:14:30,661
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do
this for us. -He's a robot...

1441
02:14:30,776 --> 02:14:34,871
so you don't have to ask him to
do anything. -Cooper, you asshole!

1442
02:14:34,943 --> 02:14:39,320
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
- It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1443
02:14:39,337 --> 02:14:42,287
It's our only chance to
save people on Earth,

1444
02:14:42,364 --> 02:14:44,629
if I can find a way to
transmit the quantum

1445
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:47,126
data I'll find in there,
maybe they'll make it.

1446
02:14:48,714 --> 02:14:51,051
Let's just hope there is
still someone there to save.

1447
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:21,460
Maximum velocity achieved.

1448
02:15:21,536 --> 02:15:26,376
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1449
02:15:26,449 --> 02:15:28,985
Ready? -Ready. -Ready.

1450
02:15:29,071 --> 02:15:35,286
Main engine ignition
in 3, 2, 1...

1451
02:15:50,974 --> 02:15:53,072
Engines of Lander
1 on my command,

1452
02:15:53,983 --> 02:15:58,928
3, 2, 1...

1453
02:16:03,192 --> 02:16:06,321
Engines of Ranger
2 on my command,

1454
02:16:06,395 --> 02:16:10,956
3, 2, 1...

1455
02:16:20,179 --> 02:16:24,136
This little maneuver is
gonna cost us 51 years!!

1456
02:16:24,214 --> 02:16:27,528
You're not too bad for
someone pushing 120!

1457
02:16:42,641 --> 02:16:45,815
Lander 1, prepare to
detach on my mark,

1458
02:16:45,925 --> 02:16:51,748
3, 2, 1...

1459
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,874
Detach!

1460
02:16:55,779 --> 02:17:00,347
Goodbye TARS! -Goodbye Dr. Brand.
See you on the other side Coop.

1461
02:17:00,424 --> 02:17:01,768
See you there slick!

1462
02:17:10,301 --> 02:17:13,754
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1463
02:17:13,869 --> 02:17:16,333
Learned from the master!

1464
02:17:16,414 --> 02:17:18,921
Ranger 2, prepare
for detachment.

1465
02:17:19,004 --> 02:17:22,683
- What, no, no! Cooper,
Cooper, what are you doing??

1466
02:17:22,791 --> 02:17:26,060
Newton's third law. You gotta
leave something behind!

1467
02:17:26,429 --> 02:17:30,838
You said we had enough resources
for both of us! -We agreed Amelia,

1468
02:17:30,873 --> 02:17:33,405
90%

1469
02:17:33,518 --> 02:17:35,680
No!

1470
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:39,130
Detach.

1471
02:17:52,513 --> 02:17:54,939
Okay, we're nosing down.

1472
02:17:58,419 --> 02:18:00,650
Approaching the event horizon.

1473
02:18:01,843 --> 02:18:07,815
Portside, dipping down
beneath it..., to go

1474
02:18:07,827 --> 02:18:13,948
through it. Heading towards...
blackness... <I have a visual of the event!>

1475
02:18:14,172 --> 02:18:16,044
It's all black!

1476
02:18:18,385 --> 02:18:22,463
TARS, do you read me?
It's all black.

1477
02:18:23,261 --> 02:18:26,122
TARS, do you read me? Over.

1478
02:18:30,740 --> 02:18:37,070
We're... we're getting screens,
We're getting interference.

1479
02:18:38,914 --> 02:18:40,177
Losing control of the stick.

1480
02:18:40,281 --> 02:18:44,204
We've got flashes. Flashes
of lightness and blackness.

1481
02:18:44,279 --> 02:18:48,983
There's a turbulence
in the gravity.

1482
02:18:53,666 --> 02:18:56,586
Computers going down.

1483
02:19:08,227 --> 02:19:11,459
The gravitational pull, we're
losing control of the stick.

1484
02:19:44,465 --> 02:19:46,623
Murph! Murph, come on!

1485
02:21:53,486 --> 02:21:54,568
Murph!

1486
02:22:04,975 --> 02:22:07,101
Murph! Murph!! Murphhh!!

1487
02:22:15,673 --> 02:22:16,673
Murph!!

1488
02:22:23,464 --> 02:22:26,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

1489
02:22:26,740 --> 02:22:28,148
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

1490
02:22:29,155 --> 02:22:30,273
No, no!!!!!!!

1491
02:23:29,479 --> 02:23:33,435
If you're leaving just go! -No.

1492
02:23:34,408 --> 02:23:38,163
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

1493
02:23:40,543 --> 02:23:46,987
Morse, Morse, Morse.

1494
02:23:47,107 --> 02:23:48,107
'S'

1495
02:23:54,074 --> 02:23:55,074
'T'

1496
02:23:58,102 --> 02:24:00,562
'A'

1497
02:24:01,408 --> 02:24:02,580
'-'

1498
02:24:04,464 --> 02:24:06,758
'-'

1499
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:11,403
Murph, we don't have
time for this, come on!

1500
02:24:17,302 --> 02:24:18,400
STAY!!!

1501
02:24:28,677 --> 02:24:33,716
Come on, come on,
Murph, Murph, come on!

1502
02:24:33,728 --> 02:24:39,271
What's it say? What's it say?
What's it say?

1503
02:24:46,477 --> 02:24:47,477
It say's STAY!

1504
02:25:23,132 --> 02:25:25,883
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1505
02:25:28,264 --> 02:25:31,069
Make him, make him stay Murph.

1506
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:36,897
STAY

1507
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:41,595
Make him stay Murph!

1508
02:25:42,822 --> 02:25:45,409
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

1509
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:51,456
Don't, DON'T LET
ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

1510
02:25:56,267 --> 02:25:58,720
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!!!

1511
02:26:19,736 --> 02:26:21,427
It was you!!

1512
02:26:32,602 --> 02:26:35,087
You were my ghost!!

1513
02:26:46,697 --> 02:26:50,450
Cooper, Cooper come in. -TARS??

1514
02:26:50,607 --> 02:26:52,041
Roger that.

1515
02:26:53,414 --> 02:26:56,608
You survived? -Somewhere...

1516
02:26:56,725 --> 02:27:00,935
in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

1517
02:27:01,052 --> 02:27:04,576
Yeah? Well who the
hell is 'They'?

1518
02:27:04,687 --> 02:27:06,813
And just why would
they want to help us?

1519
02:27:06,894 --> 02:27:09,979
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1520
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:12,313
inside their five
dimensional reality to allow

1521
02:27:12,325 --> 02:27:14,716
you to understand it. -Yeah
well it ain't working.

1522
02:27:14,792 --> 02:27:20,909
Yes it is. You've seen that time, is
represented as a physical dimension.

1523
02:27:21,029 --> 02:27:25,585
You've worked out that you can exert a
force across space-time. -Gravity...

1524
02:27:26,629 --> 02:27:29,246
to send a message?
- Affirmative.

1525
02:27:31,187 --> 02:27:33,157
Gravity...

1526
02:27:33,273 --> 02:27:37,731
can cross the dimensions,
including time?

1527
02:27:38,006 --> 02:27:39,268
-Apparently.

1528
02:27:43,056 --> 02:27:46,974
Do you have the quantum data?
- Roger, I have it.

1529
02:27:47,084 --> 02:27:50,421
I've translated it on
all wavelengths...

1530
02:27:50,422 --> 02:27:54,583
but nothing is getting out Cooper.
- I can do this, I can.

1531
02:27:54,632 --> 02:27:59,266
But such complicated data to a child?
- Not just any child.

1532
02:28:01,106 --> 02:28:02,937
Come on dad!

1533
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:07,736
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1534
02:28:07,807 --> 02:28:09,789
Even though you communicate
it here, she won't

1535
02:28:09,801 --> 02:28:11,498
understand it's
significance for years!

1536
02:28:11,661 --> 02:28:16,530
No, no, I get that TARS, but we've got
to figure something out alright...

1537
02:28:16,642 --> 02:28:19,273
or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

1538
02:28:19,546 --> 02:28:23,152
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1539
02:28:26,818 --> 02:28:31,717
Say that again. -They didn't bring
us here, to change the past.

1540
02:28:35,929 --> 02:28:38,737
No, they didn't bring
us here at all.

1541
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:44,860
We brought ourselves!

1542
02:28:53,975 --> 02:28:58,385
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA, in binary.

1543
02:28:58,512 --> 02:29:00,843
In binary, roger,
translating data.

1544
02:29:24,544 --> 02:29:27,316
It's not a ghost.

1545
02:29:28,254 --> 02:29:32,761
It's gravity. -Don't
you get it yet TARS?

1546
02:29:32,874 --> 02:29:34,714
I brought myself here!

1547
02:29:35,211 --> 02:29:39,161
We're here to communicate, with
the three dimensional world!

1548
02:29:39,698 --> 02:29:40,998
We are the bridge!

1549
02:29:48,177 --> 02:29:51,272
I thought they chose me.

1550
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:57,908
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
- For what Cooper?

1551
02:30:00,402 --> 02:30:02,021
To save the world!

1552
02:30:06,058 --> 02:30:10,185
All of this! In one,
little girl's bedroom.

1553
02:30:10,297 --> 02:30:12,719
Every moment, it's
infinitely complex.

1554
02:30:12,826 --> 02:30:15,819
They have access to
infinite time and space...

1555
02:30:15,820 --> 02:30:17,448
but they're not
bound by anything!

1556
02:30:17,577 --> 02:30:22,327
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1557
02:30:22,443 --> 02:30:26,100
That's why I'm here. -I'm
here to find a way...

1558
02:30:26,124 --> 02:30:29,256
to tell Murph, just like I
found this moment. -How Cooper?

1559
02:30:29,372 --> 02:30:30,928
Love TARS, love!

1560
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,634
It's just like Brand said, my connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1561
02:30:34,742 --> 02:30:37,245
It is the key. -Why are we here?

1562
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:40,342
To find out how to tell.

1563
02:30:42,859 --> 02:30:44,621
The watch!

1564
02:30:47,655 --> 02:30:51,319
The watch!

1565
02:30:53,555 --> 02:30:56,714
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1566
02:31:00,139 --> 02:31:04,135
TARS, translate the data into
Morse and give it to me.

1567
02:31:04,208 --> 02:31:07,565
Translating the data to Morse. Cooper,
what if she never came back for it?

1568
02:31:08,903 --> 02:31:12,533
She will. She will.

1569
02:31:14,153 --> 02:31:17,935
He's coming Murph!

1570
02:31:19,052 --> 02:31:24,030
Okay, coming down!
- How do you know?

1571
02:31:27,489 --> 02:31:29,255
Because I gave it to her!

1572
02:31:33,902 --> 02:31:37,360
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

1573
02:31:40,206 --> 02:31:45,093
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

1574
02:31:45,168 --> 02:31:47,405
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1575
02:31:47,481 --> 02:31:52,161
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1576
02:32:12,073 --> 02:32:15,995
It was him!!

1577
02:32:16,108 --> 02:32:19,418
All the time!! I knew it!!!

1578
02:32:19,504 --> 02:32:21,687
Dad saved us!!

1579
02:33:04,946 --> 02:33:07,570
Eureka!!!

1580
02:33:10,022 --> 02:33:11,930
It's traditional.

1581
02:33:16,042 --> 02:33:17,805
Eureka!!!

1582
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:25,955
Did it work? -I think
it might have.

1583
02:33:27,325 --> 02:33:28,981
How do you know?

1584
02:33:29,061 --> 02:33:32,505
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1585
02:33:36,333 --> 02:33:38,345
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1586
02:33:38,418 --> 02:33:41,729
They're not beings.

1587
02:33:41,805 --> 02:33:43,495
They're us!

1588
02:33:45,009 --> 02:33:48,781
What I've been doing for Murph,
they've been doing for me!

1589
02:33:48,896 --> 02:33:52,775
For all of us. -Cooper,
people couldn't build this.

1590
02:33:52,851 --> 02:33:57,388
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

1591
02:33:57,539 --> 02:34:01,416
Not you and me. But people.

1592
02:34:01,488 --> 02:34:07,138
A civilization that's evolved past
the 4 dimensions that we know.

1593
02:34:12,693 --> 02:34:13,805
What happens now?

1594
02:35:16,773 --> 02:35:17,773
Mr. Cooper.

1595
02:35:22,281 --> 02:35:26,069
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1596
02:35:26,181 --> 02:35:28,949
Remember you're no
spring chicken anymore.

1597
02:35:29,059 --> 02:35:31,502
Actually you are one hundred
and twenty four years old.

1598
02:35:38,539 --> 02:35:40,155
Take it slow sir.

1599
02:35:41,614 --> 02:35:43,128
You were, um, extremely lucky.

1600
02:35:43,236 --> 02:35:47,513
The Rangers found you with only
minutes left in your oxygen supply.

1601
02:35:59,516 --> 02:36:02,290
Where am I?

1602
02:36:04,204 --> 02:36:05,787
Cooper station.

1603
02:36:07,050 --> 02:36:08,713
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1604
02:36:09,947 --> 02:36:12,690
Cooper station?

1605
02:36:15,448 --> 02:36:17,887
What nice of you to
name it after me!

1606
02:36:20,942 --> 02:36:24,526
What? -Well, the station
isn't named after you sir,

1607
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:26,100
It's uh, it's named
after your daughter.

1608
02:36:26,115 --> 02:36:30,539
Although she's always maintained just how
important you were. -Is she still alive?

1609
02:36:30,613 --> 02:36:34,477
She'll be here in a
couple of weeks.

1610
02:36:35,567 --> 02:36:38,817
She is far too old to be transferred
from another station...

1611
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:41,122
but when she heard
that you'd been found.

1612
02:36:41,229 --> 02:36:44,756
Well this is, this is Murphy
Cooper we're talking about!

1613
02:36:44,867 --> 02:36:46,741
Yes it is!

1614
02:36:49,222 --> 02:36:51,382
We'll have you checked out
of here in a couple of days.

1615
02:36:54,301 --> 02:36:56,869
I'm sure you'll be excited
to see what's in store.

1616
02:36:57,522 --> 02:37:02,396
I actually uhh, did a paper
on you, in high school,

1617
02:37:02,504 --> 02:37:04,132
I know all about your
life back on Earth.

1618
02:37:05,931 --> 02:37:08,632
Oh yeah, right.

1619
02:37:10,004 --> 02:37:16,365
Sir, if you could follow me? You've
got a really good situation.

1620
02:37:20,147 --> 02:37:23,537
So um, when I made my
suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

1621
02:37:24,873 --> 02:37:27,817
I was delighted to hear that
she thought it was perfect.

1622
02:37:34,438 --> 02:37:38,200
Well of course, I didn't
speak to her in person.

1623
02:37:42,429 --> 02:37:47,313
My dad was a farmer. Like
everybody else back then.

1624
02:37:47,422 --> 02:37:50,641
Anyway, there just
wasn't enough food.

1625
02:37:50,753 --> 02:37:56,727
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1626
02:37:57,021 --> 02:37:59,284
So we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

1627
02:38:07,025 --> 02:38:09,677
She did confirm, just how
much you loved farming.

1628
02:38:09,758 --> 02:38:12,141
She did? Did she?

1629
02:38:12,215 --> 02:38:15,529
Well, home sweet home!

1630
02:38:15,601 --> 02:38:19,229
Everything is in its place
and faithfully reproduced.

1631
02:38:19,310 --> 02:38:20,695
Yes.

1632
02:38:25,244 --> 02:38:30,517
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

1633
02:38:30,630 --> 02:38:33,994
It's power source is shot, but we
can get another one if you want.

1634
02:38:34,103 --> 02:38:35,863
Yes, please!

1635
02:38:37,126 --> 02:38:38,126
Settings.

1636
02:38:39,105 --> 02:38:40,105
General settings.

1637
02:38:41,097 --> 02:38:42,280
Security settings.

1638
02:38:44,408 --> 02:38:47,423
Honesty, new setting.

1639
02:38:48,658 --> 02:38:53,518
95% Confirmed. Additional
customization?

1640
02:38:53,592 --> 02:38:58,272
Humor: 75%

1641
02:38:58,382 --> 02:38:59,935
Confirmed.

1642
02:39:00,046 --> 02:39:04,053
Auto self-destruct
T minus 10, 9...

1643
02:39:04,158 --> 02:39:05,740
Let's make that 60%.

1644
02:39:07,514 --> 02:39:10,317
60% confirmed.

1645
02:39:10,390 --> 02:39:14,138
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1646
02:39:18,503 --> 02:39:20,503
Is this really what it was like?

1647
02:39:22,845 --> 02:39:25,549
It was never this clean slick.

1648
02:39:30,270 --> 02:39:34,793
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

1649
02:39:35,622 --> 02:39:37,853
I want to know where we are?

1650
02:39:38,978 --> 02:39:41,309
Where are we going?

1651
02:39:46,183 --> 02:39:48,645
Mr Cooper. -Yes? -The
family is all in there.

1652
02:39:48,802 --> 02:39:50,433
Family?

1653
02:39:50,544 --> 02:39:54,392
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1654
02:40:27,034 --> 02:40:29,800
You told them I liked farming?

1655
02:40:35,241 --> 02:40:36,393
It was me Murph!

1656
02:40:38,839 --> 02:40:41,250
I was your ghost!

1657
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:43,774
I know.

1658
02:40:45,901 --> 02:40:51,545
People didn't believe me, they thought
I was doing it all myself. But...

1659
02:40:54,721 --> 02:40:57,134
I knew who it was.

1660
02:41:01,277 --> 02:41:03,368
Nobody believed me.

1661
02:41:03,487 --> 02:41:06,431
But I knew you'd come back.

1662
02:41:08,234 --> 02:41:09,849
How?

1663
02:41:11,190 --> 02:41:15,150
Because my dad promised me!

1664
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:25,642
I'm here now Murph. I'm here!

1665
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:34,894
No. No parent should have to
watch their own child die.

1666
02:41:37,028 --> 02:41:41,166
I have my kids here for me now.

1667
02:41:43,436 --> 02:41:45,505
You go!

1668
02:41:48,058 --> 02:41:49,058
Where?

1669
02:41:52,352 --> 02:41:54,479
Brand.

1670
02:42:03,505 --> 02:42:06,299
She's, out there.

1671
02:42:10,863 --> 02:42:13,829
Setting up camp.

1672
02:42:40,381 --> 02:42:45,814
Alone, in a strange galaxy.

1673
02:42:56,554 --> 02:43:00,023
Maybe right now
she's, settling in...

1674
02:43:00,058 --> 02:43:02,378
for the long nap.

1675
02:43:18,324 --> 02:43:22,753
By the light of our new sun.

1676
02:43:37,669 --> 02:43:40,369
In our new home.

1677
02:43:40,393 --> 02:45:40,393
