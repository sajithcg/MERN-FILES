        <p>Weird Faith is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Madi Diaz (pictured), released on February 9, 2024, on the record label Anti-. The album followed her fifth studio album, History of a Feeling, as well as tours with Angel Olsen, Waxahatchee, and Harry Styles. It was written in Nashville and upstate New York, recorded in the latter by Diaz and Sam Cohen, and produced by Diaz, Cohen, and Konrad Snyder. Weird Faith has been described as an indie rock, indie folk, and indie pop album. The album features sparse, acoustic arrangements that highlight Diaz's lyrics and vocals, and it addresses themes of love, trust, and intimacy. Critics positively reviewed the album, particularly praising Diaz's emotional songwriting and the album's production. It was featured on several year-end lists and was nominated for two Grammy Awards. (Full article...)</p>
